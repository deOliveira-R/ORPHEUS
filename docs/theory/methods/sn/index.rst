Synopsis
========

The discrete ordinates (S\ :sub:`N`) method solves the
:ref:`multi-group eigenvalue problem <mg-eigenvalue-problem>` in
integro-differential form by discretising the direction variable
:math:`\hat{\Omega}` into a finite ordinate set
:math:`\{(\hat{\Omega}_m, w_m)\}`, **retaining the angular flux**
:math:`\psi(\mathbf{r}, \hat{\Omega}, E)` rather than collapsing to the
scalar flux (contrast the collision-probability integral form).  It resolves
streaming, anisotropic scattering, and interface angular current directly.
ORPHEUS supports three coordinate systems under one balance framework:
**Cartesian** (slab / 2-D, no inter-ordinate coupling), **spherical** (1-D
radial, a single :math:`\alpha`-redistribution dome coupling all ordinates in
:math:`\mu`), and **cylindrical** (1-D radial, an independent :math:`\alpha`
dome per :math:`\mu`-level).  All three share a geometry factor
:math:`\Delta A / w` that guarantees per-ordinate flat-flux consistency; the
curvilinear formulation follows [BaileyMorelChang2010]_ (Eq. 43, the
Morel–Montry angular-closure weight — unique exact-on-linear-in-:math:`\mu`),
the general framework [LewisMiller1984]_, and the angular discretisation
[CaseZweifel1967]_ / [Hebert2009]_ (§3.9.4).

The solver is posed as an **operator algebra** over five operators: streaming
:math:`L` (bulk :math:`\hat{\Omega}\cdot\nabla`), collision / removal
:math:`C`, the scattering gain :math:`S`, the boundary law :math:`B` — a
first-class **sibling** operator, *not* folded into :math:`L` — and the rank-1
fission dyad :math:`F`.  They compose the within-group loss operator
:math:`A = L + C - S - B`, so the eigenvalue problem is
:math:`A\,\psi = \tfrac{1}{k}\,F\,\psi` (fixed source: :math:`A\,\psi = q`).
The sub-composite :math:`(L+C)` is lower-triangular under the upwind cell
ordering, which is exactly why :math:`(L+C)^{-1}` **is** the transport sweep
(:doc:`/theory/methods/sn/loss_representation`).  :class:`SNSolver` satisfies
the :class:`~numerics.eigenvalue.EigenvalueSolver` protocol and
:func:`solve_sn` returns an :class:`SNResult`.  Because the protocol places the
scattering source *inside* ``solve_fixed_source``, the inner source iteration
(in-scatter + anisotropic convergence) stays encapsulated in the SN sweep,
while the outer :func:`~numerics.eigenvalue.power_iteration` loop is the one
shared by CP, MoC, diffusion, and the homogeneous solver (see
:doc:`/api/numerics` for the protocol contract).

The spatial closure is **diamond difference** with the Morel–Montry weight
(:math:`\beta = 0`); the per-ordinate discrete transport is the **sweep**,
which is byte-identical to the loss-operator **matvec** — one loss
representation, two applications (``solve`` vs residual).  Both the 1-D scan
(:meth:`~orpheus.sn.loss_representation.CumprodScan.sweep`) and the 2-D
wavefront sweep
(:class:`~orpheus.sn.loss_representation.sweep_graph.SweepDependencyGraph`,
per-octant batched dispatch over a mesh-time-precomputed DAG) are **bare**:
the reflective coupling :math:`\psi.\text{inflow} = B\,\psi.\text{outflow}`
rides as a sibling :math:`-B` source term rather than a re-applied boundary
condition (:ref:`bare-sweep-extraction`, and the canonical algebra
:ref:`bc-extraction` in :doc:`/theory/foundations/boundary_conditions`).  2-D Cartesian eigenvalue
problems solve through **both** inner drivers —
:class:`~orpheus.numerics.iteration.SourceIteration` (the geometry-agnostic
default) and :class:`~orpheus.numerics.iteration.KrylovAcceleration` —
verified SI ≡ Krylov ≡ closed-form :math:`k_\infty`
(:ref:`bc-extraction-2d-si-krylov-twin`).  Interior cell-face fluxes are typed
as an interior 1-cochain :math:`C^1_{\rm int}` carried in the rolling front
(:ref:`wavefront-flux-cochain`).

Curvilinear redistribution — the geometric :math:`\alpha`-dome, distinct from
Legendre :math:`P_1^+` scattering anisotropy — and its half-angle
**starting-direction seed** are first-class typed state.  The Issue #282 route
(a) design marches :math:`\psi_{1/2}` directly from the true :math:`q_{1/2}`
source through System B's named resolvent
:meth:`RadialCharacteristicOperator.solve <orpheus.sn.operators.radial_characteristic.RadialCharacteristicOperator.solve>`
(a single-pass exact inverse on the *full* Legendre fold), only on levels
whose first-ordinate raw :math:`\tau \in (0,1)` (**R12a**); see
:ref:`sn-282-direct-starting-direction-solve`.  The "#229 floor" resolution
— three distinct curvilinear errors separated by a
volume-weighted-:math:`L_2`-vs-:math:`L_\infty` norm difference — is
:ref:`sn-curvilinear-aniso-norm-reconciliation`.  The storage / index /
scattering / closure **conventions** and the load-bearing **invariants** are
captured structurally in the machine header above and cross-linked below;
verification is L0–L2 plus semi-analytical (Sood, Case singular-eigenfunction)
benchmarks; the traps that hide solver bugs behind green tests are collected in

Architecture
============

.. note:: **Implementation map — automation pending.**  The auto-generated
   Nexus filtered flow-graph figure (root symbol + traversal depth →
   graphviz) that will head this section is blocked on the nexus#20
   flow-graph directive; until it ships, the architecture below is
   **hand-authored**.  See :doc:`/api/numerics` for the live
   operator-protocol surface and :doc:`/theory/foundations/operator_algebra` for the algebra.

Two-Layer Mesh Pattern
----------------------

The S\ :sub:`N` solver follows the same two-layer pattern as the CP
solver.  This pattern (base :class:`~geometry.mesh.Mesh1D` + augmented
mesh) is shared with :ref:`theory-collision-probability` and
:ref:`theory-method-of-characteristics`.

1. **Base geometry** --- :class:`~geometry.mesh.Mesh1D` or
   :class:`~geometry.mesh.Mesh2D` stores cell edges, material IDs,
   coordinate system, and **boundary condition declarations**.
   Each face carries an optional :class:`~geometry.mesh.BC` field
   (``bc_left``/``bc_right`` for 1-D;
   ``bc_xmin``/``bc_xmax``/``bc_ymin``/``bc_ymax`` for 2-D).
   When ``None`` (the default), the solver applies its own default
   --- for the SN solver, that default is reflective.
   See :ref:`boundary-conditions` for details.

2. **Augmented geometry** --- :class:`SNMesh` pairs the spatial mesh
   with an angular quadrature, precomputing the coordinate-specific
   streaming stencil.  Its **primary representation is the per-axis
   tuple** :attr:`SNMesh.axes` (the SN phase space factors as a tensor
   product of per-axis 1-D meshes): a legacy ``Mesh1D`` / ``Mesh2D`` is
   converted to axes **once** at the inbound boundary, and
   :meth:`SNMesh.from_axes` stores the caller's tuple verbatim. After
   C5 (:ref:`sn-axis-primary-c5`) :attr:`SNMesh.mesh` is *inbound
   provenance only* — ``None`` for an axis-native :math:`d \ge 3` mesh,
   which carries no legacy mesh at all.  It also **resolves boundary
   conditions**: each ``BC`` tag
   on the mesh is looked up in :attr:`SNMesh.BOUNDARY_OPERATOR_REGISTRY` and converted
   to a validated kind string (``"vacuum"`` or ``"reflective"``)
   stored in the face-name-keyed :attr:`SNMesh.bc` dict
   (``sn_mesh.bc["xmin"]``, ``sn_mesh.bc["xmax"]``, ... — the dict
   keys are the mesh's true boundary faces; see
   :ref:`bc-face-name-carve`).
   The sweep reads these resolved strings directly --- it never
   inspects the raw :class:`~geometry.mesh.BC` objects.  Precomputed
   stencil contents per coordinate system:

   - **Cartesian**: one per-axis array ``streaming(a)[n,i] =
     2|mu_a|/da[i]`` for every axis ``a < ndim`` (built over
     ``range(ndim)`` from ``quad.axis_cosines(a)`` since C3.6 ---
     no hand-listed x/y pair, no phantom axis on a slab) --- the
     diamond-difference denominator terms, precomputed to avoid
     per-cell division in the sweep hot loop.
   - **Spherical**: ``face_areas`` (:math:`4\pi r^2`), ``delta_A``,
     ``alpha_half`` (angular redistribution dome), and
     ``redist_dAw`` (:math:`\Delta A_i / w_n`, shape ``(nx, N)``).
   - **Cylindrical**: ``face_areas`` (:math:`2\pi r`), ``delta_A``,
     ``alpha_per_level`` (per-level redistribution domes), and
     ``redist_dAw_per_level`` (list of ``(nx, M)`` arrays).

   The Morel--Montry angular weight :math:`\tau` is **not** a factory
   output: it is owned by the angular closure
   (:attr:`~orpheus.sn.sweep.pole_angular_closure.PoleAngularClosureBase.tau_per_ordinate`),
   since the geometry-side producer was retired in Issue #236 Phase 2
   Step C (see :ref:`sn-tau-c-on-cellvisit-live`).  The geometry
   factories carry **geometry only** — face areas, the
   :math:`\alpha`-dome, the redistribution factor :math:`\Delta A/w`,
   and the level starting-direction edge :math:`\mu_{1/2}`.

3. **Solver** --- :func:`solve_sn` creates an ``SNMesh``, builds the
   ``SNSolver``, and runs power iteration. At :math:`d \le 2` the input
   is a ``Mesh1D`` / ``Mesh2D``; at :math:`d = 3` the input is the
   **axes tuple** itself (the only 3-D entry — there is no ``Mesh3D``;
   see :ref:`sn-c5-3d-admission`).

Quadrature Dispatch
-------------------

The geometry-and-quadrature dispatch is a first-class polymorphism:
:func:`~orpheus.sn.loss_representation.default_for` selects the
:class:`~orpheus.sn.loss_representation.LossRepresentation` whose declared
``supports`` predicate matches the mesh — the 1-D chain scan
(:class:`~orpheus.sn.loss_representation.CumprodScan`, any geometry) or the
multi-D anti-hyperplane wavefront — and the operator then calls it
branchlessly.  (This replaced the pre-carve procedural branch on the
``SNMesh.curvature`` string tags and the since-retired operator-free
``transport_sweep`` entry; the full carve is documented in
:doc:`/theory/methods/sn/loss_representation`.)  Boundary conditions are **not** passed as
a parameter to the sweep --- it reads the resolved BC kind strings
directly from the face-name-keyed :attr:`SNMesh.bc` dict
(``sn_mesh.bc["xmin"]``, ``sn_mesh.bc["xmax"]``, ...; see
:ref:`bc-face-name-carve`).

For 1D meshes (``ny=1``):

- **Gauss--Legendre** quadrature takes the fast 1-D chain-scan
  (:class:`~orpheus.sn.loss_representation.CumprodScan`) path (all
  :math:`\mu_y = 0`, so no y-streaming).
- **Lebedev** quadrature falls through to the 2D wavefront sweep.
  Ordinates with :math:`\mu_x \neq 0` stream along *x*; the
  *y*-streaming terms cancel via reflective BCs on the single-cell
  *y*-dimension.  Ordinates with :math:`\mu_x = \mu_y = 0`
  (z-directed) reduce to pure collision:
  :math:`\psi = Q \cdot w_{\text{norm}} / \Sigt{}`.

Both quadratures recover the analytical eigenvalue exactly on
homogeneous problems (verified to machine precision for 1G/2G/4G).


The Transport Equation
======================

The 1-D slab form — the base of the broadening progression — is
posed in :doc:`slab_one_group`; the multi-group energy extension in
:doc:`slab_multigroup`; the 2-D Cartesian form in
:doc:`cartesian_multid`. The curvilinear geometries below extend
them.

Spherical 1D
-------------

In spherical coordinates the transport equation acquires an **angular
redistribution term** that couples ordinates:

.. math::
   :label: transport-spherical

   \mu \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial r}
   + \frac{1 - \mu^2}{r} \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial \mu}
   + \Sigt{} \psi = \frac{Q}{W}

The curvature term :math:`(1 - \mu^2)/r \cdot \partial\psi/\partial\mu`
arises because a neutron streaming radially at angle :math:`\mu` *rotates*
its direction cosine as it moves to a different radius.  Discretising this
term requires diamond difference in **both space and angle**.

Cylindrical 1D
---------------

For an infinitely long cylinder with azimuthal symmetry, the transport
equation in the radial variable :math:`r` is:

.. math::
   :label: transport-cylindrical

   \frac{\eta}{r} \frac{\partial(r\psi)}{\partial r}
   - \frac{1}{r} \frac{\partial(\xi\psi)}{\partial\varphi}
   + \Sigt{} \psi = \frac{Q}{W}

where the direction cosines are:

- :math:`\eta = \sin\theta\cos\varphi` --- radial projection (streaming)
- :math:`\xi = \sin\theta\sin\varphi` --- azimuthal component
- :math:`\mu = \cos\theta` --- axial component

The constraint :math:`\eta^2 + \xi^2 + \mu^2 = 1` holds.  The azimuthal
redistribution :math:`-\partial(\xi\psi)/\partial\varphi` couples ordinates
on each :math:`\mu`-level.

The Discrete Balance Equation
=============================

This is the core of the S\ :sub:`N` method.  The balance equations are
presented from simplest to most complex, in the progression chapters:
Cartesian geometries have no angular redistribution — the 1-D slab
balance is derived in :doc:`slab_one_group`, the 2-D Cartesian balance
in :doc:`cartesian_multid`; curvilinear geometries add :math:`\alpha`
coupling and a geometry factor :math:`\Delta A/w` —
:doc:`curvilinear_one_group`.

.. _cell-update-strategies:

Cell update strategies (the strategy contract)
==============================================

The discrete balance equation (the slab DD :eq:`dd-cartesian-1d` of
:doc:`slab_one_group`, the M-M-closed curvilinear update :eq:`dd-solve`
of :doc:`curvilinear_one_group`) yields, for
each cell, a small algebraic system: combine the upstream face flux
(and, for sphere/cylinder, the upstream angular half-flux) with a
local source and the cell's total cross section to produce the
cell-average flux plus the downstream states.  The closure relating
:math:`\overline{\psi}_i` to :math:`\psi_{i-1/2}` and
:math:`\psi_{i+1/2}` is **not unique** — Diamond Difference (DD),
weighted DD, Linear Discontinuous (LD), Step, and Exponential
Characteristic (EC) are all valid choices, each with different
truncation error, positivity, and cost.  Per Cardinal Rule 2
(architecture), the cell-update math is **the same algebra** in slab,
sphere, and cylindrical 1-D — only the populated fields of the
:class:`~orpheus.geometry.reduced_operator.StreamingTerms` packet
change.  Lifting the closure into a strategy contract makes the
sweep driver thin and lets each closure be unit-tested in isolation.

The strategy contract is owned by
:mod:`orpheus.transport.spatial.scheme`.

The Protocol
------------

The contract is a ``@runtime_checkable`` ``typing.Protocol`` —
satisfied by structural typing, not inheritance — exposing two class-
level traits and a single :meth:`update` method:

* :class:`~orpheus.transport.spatial.scheme.DiscretizationScheme`

  - ``is_linear: bool`` — whether the closure is linear in its inputs.
    Diamond Difference is linear; Step's positivity-fixup, weighted-DD
    with a flux-dependent weight, and EC with a clipped argument are
    not.
  - ``is_positivity_preserving: bool`` — whether non-negative inputs
    guarantee non-negative outputs.  Diamond Difference is **not**
    positivity preserving (Lewis & Miller §5.3, where DD's tendency
    to produce negative cell-edge fluxes is exhibited and motivates
    the choice of Step or weighted-DD in stiff cells); Step is.
  - ``update(visit, total_xs, source, upstream_state) ->
    CellResult`` — the cell update itself.  ``visit`` is a
    :class:`~orpheus.transport.spatial.scheme.CellVisit` packet (see
    next subsection) that combines the geometric
    :class:`~orpheus.geometry.reduced_operator.StreamingTerms` with
    sweep-direction-resolved data.

The two helper dataclasses (frozen, slotted) carry the per-cell
state:

* :class:`~orpheus.transport.spatial.scheme.UpstreamState`

  - ``spatial_upstream: np.ndarray`` — shape ``(ng,)``.  Face flux
    entering the cell from the upstream face (always populated).
  - ``angular_upstream: np.ndarray | None`` — shape ``(ng,)`` for
    sphere/cylinder; ``None`` for slab.  :math:`\psi_{n-1/2,\,i}`,
    the half-flux at the upstream half-angle.

* :class:`~orpheus.transport.spatial.scheme.CellResult`

  - ``cell_average_flux: np.ndarray`` — shape ``(ng,)``.  The cell-
    average flux :math:`\overline{\psi}_i = \mathrm{numer}/\mathrm{denom}`
    from the closure's algebraic solve.
  - ``outgoing_spatial_flux: np.ndarray | None`` — shape ``(ng,)`` in
    the typical case; ``None`` for the cylindrical pure-azimuthal
    degenerate case where the cell has no radial face flow (see
    below).
  - ``outgoing_angular_state: np.ndarray | None`` — shape ``(ng,)``
    for sphere/cylinder; ``None`` for slab.  :math:`\psi_{n+1/2,\,i}`
    from the Morel--Montry closure.

The SN sweep DAG and ``CellVisit``
-----------------------------------

The SN sweep is a **topological sort of a directed cell graph**.
For a given ordinate :math:`\Omega_n`, every face :math:`f` of the
mesh is oriented by the sign of :math:`\Omega_n \cdot \hat n_f` — an
edge from cell :math:`A` to cell :math:`B` if :math:`\Omega_n` points
from :math:`A` into :math:`B` across that face.  The sweep walks
cells in a topological order over this DAG so that, when each cell is
visited, all its upstream face fluxes are already known.  This is
the SN-specific graph-theoretic concept; MoC uses a different
mathematical structure (fiber bundles + solution sheaves over
characteristic curves), and CP / diffusion / MC have no sweep at
all.  Per Cardinal Rule 2 (architecture), no shared
``SweepGraph`` Protocol is hoisted across solvers — the sweep DAG
lives in :mod:`orpheus.sn`.

The contract's :meth:`update` consumes a
:class:`~orpheus.transport.spatial.scheme.CellVisit` packet rather
than a raw
:class:`~orpheus.geometry.reduced_operator.StreamingTerms`.
The :class:`CellVisit` composes:

* ``cell_idx: int`` — the cell being visited.
* ``streaming_terms: StreamingTerms`` — the **purely geometric**
  primitive (``face_area_inner`` / ``face_area_outer`` are
  geometric labels — inner = closer to :math:`r=0`, outer =
  farther — independent of sweep direction).
* ``face_area_downstream: float | None`` — **sweep-direction-
  resolved**.  For an outward sphere or cylinder sweep
  (:math:`\mu \ge 0`) it equals ``streaming_terms.face_area_outer``;
  for an inward sweep (:math:`\mu < 0`) it equals
  ``streaming_terms.face_area_inner``.  ``None`` for slab (slab DD
  does not read face areas) and for the cylindrical pure-azimuthal
  degenerate case (no spatial flow).

The :class:`CellVisit` packets are produced by
:meth:`SNMesh.dag_walk(*, ordinate_idx=..., direction_sign=...,
mu_level_idx=None)
<orpheus.sn.mesh.augmented_mesh.SNMesh.dag_walk>` — a generator that
yields cells in DAG-topological order.  The method takes EXACTLY ONE
of ``ordinate_idx`` (single-ordinate visits, used by the sweep
driver) or ``direction_sign`` (direction-keyed visits, used by the
apply matvec) as a keyword-only argument.  Both invocation modes
encapsulate the inward / outward branching, the cylindrical
per-:math:`\mu`-level traversal, and the pure-azimuthal degenerate
handling.  The sweep at ``orpheus.sn.loss_representation`` (the dissolved ``sweep.py``) consumes this
generator::

    for visit in sn_mesh.dag_walk(ordinate_idx=n):
        upstream = UpstreamState(
            spatial_upstream=psi_face,
            angular_upstream=psi_angle[visit.cell_idx],
        )
        result = scheme.update(
            visit, total_xs, source, upstream,
        )
        ...

The cell-update strategy receives only **resolved** data — no
sign-of-:math:`\mu` branching inside the strategy.  This pattern
moves the graph-theoretic concept to where it belongs (the SN
module) and keeps the geometry-layer
:class:`~orpheus.geometry.reduced_operator.StreamingTerms`
geometry-only and reusable by future MoC / CP / diffusion modules
that have different mathematical structures.

Slab vs curvilinear discrimination
-----------------------------------

.. note:: **Superseded mechanism (Issue #196 Phase G Step 2.5 → Issue
   #236 Step C).** The ``alpha_in is None`` slab/curvilinear
   discrimination described below was **retired**: Issue #196 Phase G
   Step 2.5 gave slab *neutral* curvature (``face_area_inner =
   face_area_outer = 1.0``, ``delta_A_over_w = 0.0``) so the unified
   cell-balance helper consumes the same packet regardless of geometry,
   and Issue #236 Step C removed the Morel--Montry ``alpha_in`` /
   ``alpha_out`` / ``tau_mm`` fields from
   :class:`~orpheus.geometry.reduced_operator.StreamingTerms` entirely
   (it is now **purely geometric**; :math:`\tau` is closure-owned — see
   :ref:`sn-tau-c-on-cellvisit-live`).  Slab is now distinguished at the
   sweep level by ``upstream_state.angular_upstream is None``, not by a
   ``StreamingTerms`` field test.  The prose below records the historical
   pre-Step-2.5 convention and is pending a dedicated rewrite to the
   neutral-curvature mechanism; the authoritative current description is
   the :class:`~orpheus.geometry.reduced_operator.StreamingTerms`
   docstring.

A strategy distinguishes slab from curvilinear by a single field test
on the visit's streaming terms:

* **Slab** — ``visit.streaming_terms.alpha_in is None`` (and the rest
  of the curvature bundle, ``alpha_out``, ``delta_A_over_w``,
  ``tau_mm``, ``face_area_inner`` / ``face_area_outer``, are all
  ``None``).  ``upstream_state.angular_upstream is None``.  The
  strategy returns ``CellResult(outgoing_angular_state=None, ...)``.
* **Sphere or cylinder** —
  ``visit.streaming_terms.alpha_in is not None``; the full curvature
  bundle is populated.  ``upstream_state.angular_upstream`` carries
  :math:`\psi_{n-1/2,\,i}`.  The strategy returns the M-M-closed
  ``outgoing_angular_state``.

This single-field discrimination convention is locked in by
foundation-tier protocol-conformance tests in
``tests/sn/sweep/core/test_discretization_scheme_protocol.py``; concrete
strategies and the Wave D sweep rewrite read this same field to
dispatch.

Cylindrical pure-azimuthal degenerate case
-------------------------------------------

For cylindrical 1-D radial sweeps with a product or level-symmetric
quadrature, ordinates with axial direction cosine
:math:`|\mu_z| \to 1` have radial direction cosine
:math:`|\eta| = \sqrt{1 - \mu_z^2} \to 0`.  In this limit the cell
has **no radial face flow** — the streaming term
:math:`\mu_x \cdot \partial_r` vanishes — and the cell-update
algebra collapses to the redistribution-only form

.. math::

   \mathrm{denom} = (\Delta A / w)\,c_{\rm out} + \Sigma_t\,V_i,
   \qquad
   \mathrm{numer} = Q_i\,V_i + (\Delta A/w)\,c_{\rm in}\,\psi_{n-1/2,\,i},

with no spatial-flux contribution.  The strategy contract signals
this case by setting ``CellResult.outgoing_spatial_flux = None``: the
sweep driver, on receiving ``None``, skips the face-flux update for
that cell.  The angular M-M closure remains active — angular
redistribution physics is still present.

The numerical threshold is ``streaming_terms.abs_mu < 1e-15``, with
``abs_mu`` populated from the **global ordinate**
:math:`|\eta|` on the streaming-terms packet (resolved through
``level_indices`` for cylindrical geometry — see
:doc:`/theory/foundations/structured_geometry`, "Connection coefficients (reduced
streaming operator)").  In this case
:meth:`SNMesh.dag_walk
<orpheus.sn.mesh.augmented_mesh.SNMesh.dag_walk>` yields visits with
``face_area_downstream = 0.0`` to signal "no spatial flow" to the
strategy (Issue #196 Step 2.5 retired the ``None`` sentinel — the
slab carries ``1.0`` and degenerate cylindrical carries ``0.0`` so
the cell-balance helper consumes one geometry-blind number).

The DD recurrence
------------------

For non-degenerate cells, the closure relation reduces — for slab
geometry, the cell-update math is the DD recurrence
:eq:`dd-recurrence` (derived at :ref:`sweep-cumprod` in
:doc:`slab_one_group`); for curvilinear
geometry, it is the curvilinear DD form combining the
:math:`\Delta A/w` redistribution with the M-M angular closure.  The
sweep driver inlines this math today; Wave D (Issue #159) will
rewrite the driver to dispatch through a
:class:`~orpheus.transport.spatial.scheme.DiscretizationScheme` strategy.

The first concrete strategy — :class:`DiamondDifference` — is shipped
in Round 2 of Wave C (Issue #158) as a bit-identical extraction of
the existing inlined sweep math.  Linear Discontinuous (Lewis &
Miller §5.3 — preview), Exponential Characteristic, and Step
strategies are deferred to a Wave C-extension session, each with its
own MMS spatial-convergence verification.

Diamond Difference
------------------

The first concrete strategy is
:class:`~orpheus.transport.spatial.diamond.DiamondDifference`
(:mod:`orpheus.transport.spatial.diamond`).  It implements the **same**
algebra as the existing inlined sweep — Round 2 of Wave C is a
bit-identical extraction, gated by ``np.array_equal`` hand-calc tests
in ``tests/sn/sweep/core/test_diamond.py`` against the sweep's scalar
formulas at ``orpheus.sn.loss_representation`` (the dissolved ``sweep.py``).

Per Wave C decision **D5** (one geometry-polymorphic class), the
strategy is a single :class:`DiamondDifference` that handles slab,
sphere, and cylinder by branching on two
:class:`~orpheus.geometry.reduced_operator.StreamingTerms` fields:
``alpha_in is None`` (slab vs curvilinear) and ``abs_mu < 1e-15``
(cylindrical pure-azimuthal degenerate vs not).

**Slab branch** (``streaming_terms.alpha_in is None``).  The flat /
Cartesian DD recurrence reduces to the per-cell scalar form of
:eq:`dd-recurrence`:

.. math::
   :label: dd-slab-scalar

   \overline{\psi}_i \;=\; \tfrac12\bigl(\psi_{i-1/2}
                                         + \psi_{i+1/2}\bigr),
   \qquad
   \psi_{i+1/2} \;=\; \frac{2|\mu_n| - \Delta x_i\,\Sigma_t}
                              {2|\mu_n| + \Delta x_i\,\Sigma_t}\,
                       \psi_{i-1/2}
                   \;+\; \frac{2\,Q_i\,\Delta x_i / W}
                              {2|\mu_n| + \Delta x_i\,\Sigma_t},

with ``W = Σ_n w_n`` the quadrature weight sum, mirroring the
sweep's vectorised cumprod path
(``_sweep_1d_cumprod`` (the dissolved ``sweep.py``) lines 117–123) and per-
cell solver (``_solve_recurrence`` (the dissolved ``sweep.py``) lines 208–
222) at the operation level.  Per the strategy contract, ``source``
arrives at the cell update **already weight-normalised** by the
sweep — for slab, ``source = Q · Δx / W`` (and slab cell volume is
``V = Δx``).  For slab, the strategy sets
:attr:`~orpheus.transport.spatial.scheme.CellResult.outgoing_angular_state`
to ``None`` — slab geometry has no angular redistribution.

**Curvilinear branch** (``streaming_terms.alpha_in is not None`` and
``abs_mu ≥ 1e-15``).  Sphere or cylinder, away from the cylindrical
pure-azimuthal degenerate case.  The strategy couples the M-M
angular closure :eq:`mm-weights` to the WDD spatial closure
:eq:`wdd-closure`, with the redistribution constants

.. math::
   :label: dd-mm-closure-constants

   c_{\rm out} \;=\; \alpha_{n+\tfrac12}/\tau_n,
   \qquad
   c_{\rm in}  \;=\; \frac{1 - \tau_n}{\tau_n}\,\alpha_{n+\tfrac12}
                       + \alpha_{n-\tfrac12},

built from the Bailey 2009 dome :eq:`alpha-recursion` and the
Morel–Montry weight :eq:`mm-weights`.  The cell-update is then

.. math::
   :label: dd-curvilinear-scalar

   \overline{\psi}_{n,i} \;=\;
       \frac{Q_i\,V_i / W
             + |\mu_n|\,(A_{i-1/2} + A_{i+1/2})\,\psi^s_{n,\,{\rm in}}
             + (\Delta A_i / w_n)\,c_{\rm in}\,\psi_{n-\tfrac12,\,i}}
            {2|\mu_n|\,A^s_{\rm out}
             + (\Delta A_i / w_n)\,c_{\rm out}
             + \Sigma_t\,V_i},

mirroring ``_sweep_1d_spherical`` (the dissolved ``sweep.py``) lines
350–355 (and the structurally identical cylindrical branches at
sweep.py:511–531 / sweep.py:548–575) verbatim, with closures

.. math::

   \psi^s_{\rm out} \;=\; 2\overline{\psi}_{n,i}
                        - \psi^s_{n,\,{\rm in}},
   \qquad
   \psi_{n+\tfrac12,\,i} \;=\;
       (\overline{\psi}_{n,i}
         - (1 - \tau_n)\,\psi_{n-\tfrac12,\,i})/\tau_n.

**Cylindrical pure-azimuthal degenerate branch**
(``streaming_terms.alpha_in is not None`` and ``abs_mu < 1e-15``).
For a level whose axial direction cosine :math:`|\mu_z| \to 1`, the
radial direction cosine :math:`|\eta| \to 0` and the cell has no
radial face flow — the :math:`2|\mu| A_{\rm out}` and
:math:`|\mu|(A_{\rm in} + A_{\rm out})\,\psi^s_{\rm in}`
contributions drop out:

.. math::

   \mathrm{denom} \;=\; (\Delta A / w)\,c_{\rm out} + \Sigma_t\,V_i,
   \qquad
   \mathrm{numer} \;=\; Q_i\,V_i / W
                       + (\Delta A / w)\,c_{\rm in}\,
                          \psi_{n-\tfrac12,\,i},

mirroring ``_sweep_1d_cylindrical`` (the dissolved ``sweep.py``) lines
533–543 verbatim.  The strategy returns
:attr:`~orpheus.transport.spatial.scheme.CellResult.outgoing_spatial_flux`
``= None`` to signal "no face-flux write" to the sweep driver; the
M-M angular closure remains active.

**Traits and forward references.**  Diamond Difference has

* :attr:`~orpheus.transport.spatial.diamond.DiamondDifference.is_linear`
  ``= True`` — the cell average and downstream states are affine
  combinations of ``source`` and ``upstream_state``;
* :attr:`~orpheus.transport.spatial.diamond.DiamondDifference.is_positivity_preserving`
  ``= False`` — Lewis & Miller §5.3 exhibits the canonical thin-
  cell / large-source counter-example where DD's
  :math:`\psi_{\rm out} = 2\overline{\psi} - \psi_{\rm in}` produces
  negative outgoing flux from positive inputs.

Wave C-extension and Wave D will ship
:class:`Step` (positivity-preserving, :math:`\mathcal{O}(\Delta x)`),
:class:`LinearDiscontinuous` (:math:`\mathcal{O}(\Delta x^2)`,
better robustness in optically-thick cells), and
:class:`ExponentialCharacteristic` (positivity-preserving by
construction) as alternatives, each with its own MMS spatial-
convergence verification.

.. _sweep-algorithm:

Sweep Algorithm
===============

Because each cell's outgoing flux becomes the next cell's incoming flux,
the equations must be solved in the direction of neutron travel --- this
is called a **transport sweep**.

The 1-D slab sweep — the cumprod recurrence and the generic affine
outflow reconstruction — is derived in :doc:`slab_one_group`; the 2-D
Cartesian wavefront, its octant dependency graph, and the
multi-dimensional LD (UBLD) system in :doc:`cartesian_multid`; the 2-D
LD stress MMS in :doc:`verification`; the curvilinear machinery — the
sequential ordinate sweep, the pole angular closure (#168 Phase B),
the sweep-frame apply matvec (Phase C), and the direct :math:`\psi_{1/2}`
starting-direction solve (#282 route (a)) — in
:doc:`curvilinear_one_group`. The #168 Phases A/D/F, ERR-058, and #196
campaign record is preserved in :doc:`curvilinear_numerics`; the
section below preserves the dispatch-consolidation record (Wave D
Round 2, superseded by the ``LossRepresentation`` polymorphism).

.. _unified-sweep-dispatch:

Unified sweep dispatch
-----------------------

.. note::

   **Superseded (coupled-block campaign step 6, R-6.1, 2026-07-12).**
   This section records the Wave-D Round-2 consolidation (#161) — the
   *first* unification of the four sweep paths under a single entry, the
   operator-free ``transport_sweep``.  That entry was itself retired at
   step 6; the dispatch is now the first-class ``LossRepresentation``
   polymorphism (:func:`~orpheus.sn.loss_representation.default_for` selects
   :class:`~orpheus.sn.loss_representation.CumprodScan` for the 1-D scan,
   the anti-hyperplane wavefront for multi-D), documented in
   :doc:`/theory/methods/sn/loss_representation`.  The Wave-D narrative below is preserved as
   the origin of that unification: read ``transport_sweep`` and the
   ``ReducedStreamingOperator`` boolean-dispatch code as the then-current
   implementation, not today's.

Wave D Round 2 of the SN reshape campaign (Issue #161) consolidated
the four pre-existing sweep paths (1-D cumprod / 2-D wavefront /
spherical / cylindrical) under one operator-free ``transport_sweep``
entry point that branched
on a single boolean from the
:class:`~orpheus.geometry.reduced_operator.ReducedStreamingOperator`
primitive (Wave B Issue #6 / Wave D Round 1):

.. code-block:: python

   def transport_sweep(Q, sig_t, sn_mesh, psi_bc, Q_aniso=None):
       reduced = sn_mesh.reduced
       if reduced is not None and reduced.requires_upstream_angular_state:
           return _curvilinear_sweep(Q, sig_t, sn_mesh, psi_bc, Q_aniso)
       return _cartesian_sweep(Q, sig_t, sn_mesh, psi_bc, Q_aniso)

The pre-Wave-D dispatch did string-equality on
``sn_mesh.curvature == "spherical"`` / ``"cylindrical"`` /
``None``.  The new dispatch reads the canonical geometry-layer
property
:attr:`~orpheus.geometry.reduced_operator.ReducedStreamingOperator.requires_upstream_angular_state`
— ``False`` for slab + 2-D Cartesian (no angular redistribution
between successive half-angles), ``True`` for spherical +
cylindrical.  Two-D Cartesian sets ``sn_mesh.reduced is None``
(no curvilinear math is needed), and the dispatch falls through
to the Cartesian path.  Why this matters:

* The :class:`ReducedStreamingOperator` is the primitive that
  already encodes "does this geometry need angular
  redistribution to march the sweep?", so the dispatch reads its
  property directly instead of round-tripping through a
  string tag — Cardinal Rule 2 (architecture).  Consumers
  outside the SN sweep (MoC, CP) read the same property when
  they need the same dispatch.
* The dispatch surface shrinks from four string-equality checks
  to one boolean — a structural simplification that makes the
  control flow easier to reason about and to extend with
  additional cell-update strategies (Wave C-extension).

Cell update strategy parameter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The curvilinear sweep dispatches per-cell to
:meth:`~orpheus.transport.spatial.scheme.DiscretizationScheme.update`:

.. code-block:: python

   for cell_idx in march_order:
       st = reduced.streaming_terms(cell_idx, dir_idx, mu_level_idx=p)
       upstream = UpstreamState(
           spatial_upstream=psi_face,
           angular_upstream=psi_angle[cell_idx],
       )
       result = sn_mesh.scheme.update(
           streaming_terms=st,
           total_xs=sig_t[cell_idx],
           source=QV[cell_idx],
           upstream_state=upstream,
       )
       psi_face = result.outgoing_spatial_flux  # may be None for cylindrical degenerate
       psi_angle[cell_idx] = result.outgoing_angular_state

The cell-update strategy lives on
:attr:`~orpheus.sn.mesh.augmented_mesh.SNMesh.scheme` (introduced in
this round as a constructor argument with default
:class:`~orpheus.transport.spatial.diamond.DiamondDifference`).  The
default reproduces the inlined sweep math bit-identically — every
regression snapshot at ``tests/sn/regression/snapshots/`` was
generated with DD and continues to match bit-for-bit when the
unified sweep dispatches via ``scheme.update(...)``.  See
:ref:`cell-update-strategies` for the strategy contract and
:class:`~orpheus.transport.spatial.diamond.DiamondDifference` for the
DD scalar form.

Wave C-extension will ship :class:`Step`, :class:`LinearDiscontinuous`,
and :class:`ExponentialCharacteristic` as positivity-preserving /
higher-order alternatives; the unified dispatch infrastructure is
in place to receive them — users will pass
``scheme=LinearDiscontinuous()`` etc. at
:class:`~orpheus.sn.mesh.augmented_mesh.SNMesh` construction.

The 1-D cumprod fast path (DD-only)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Cartesian dispatch checks three preconditions before
selecting the 1-D cumprod fast path:

#. ``scheme is DiamondDifference`` — the cumprod recurrence
   :eq:`dd-recurrence` is a DD-specific algebraic identity
   (Lewis & Miller §5.3); LD / EC / Step closures do not admit
   the same recurrence.
#. Quadrature is GL1D (``ny == 1`` and all ``mu_y`` vanish).
#. Source is isotropic (``Q_aniso is None``).

If any precondition fails, the Cartesian dispatch routes
through the 2-D wavefront sweep (which handles 1-D as a
special case).  Preserving the cumprod fast path inside the
unified algorithm is required to keep the 1-D regression
snapshots bit-identical and to retain the historical
sub-millisecond sweep time for typical 1-D problems.

The 2-D wavefront sweep dispatches its DD per-cell algebra
through the storage-free kernel pair
:meth:`~orpheus.transport.spatial.scheme.DiscretizationSchemeBase.cell_kernel_batch`
/ :meth:`~orpheus.transport.spatial.scheme.DiscretizationSchemeBase.residual_kernel_batch`
on the strategy attached to the
:class:`~orpheus.sn.mesh.augmented_mesh.SNMesh` (Wave 2 of the SN
performance plan; closes Issue #4 — see
:ref:`sweep-octant-dependency-graph` for the full architecture and
:ref:`sweep-dispatch-relayering` for the S6.4(e) re-layering).
The "inlined DD math" formerly carried inside
:func:`~orpheus.sn.loss_representation._sweep_jacobi` was lifted into
:class:`~orpheus.transport.spatial.diamond.DiamondDifference` as a single
bit-identical extraction, vectorised across the
``(N_oct, n_diag, ng)`` slice — the ordinate axis, anti-diagonal
axis, and group axis simultaneously.  Wave C-extension's LD / EC
/ Step closures override the kernel pair and become drop-in
alternatives at SNMesh construction time:
``SNMesh(mesh, quad, scheme=LinearDiscontinuous())``.  The
open design point of "how to parameterise the 2-D wavefront
without breaking anti-diagonal vectorisation" is now closed: the
storage walk is the scheduler, the level operation owns the
direction fork, and the kernel pair is the closure — the contract
is per-level batched evaluation.


.. _sn-curvilinear-aniso-norm-reconciliation:

The curvilinear anisotropic-MMS "floor", reconciled (W1–W5)
===========================================================

.. admonition:: Key Facts — curvilinear anisotropic SN
   :class: important

   - **The single "#229 floor" was three distinct errors**, separated
     by a *norm difference*: the production gates measure a
     **volume-weighted L2** :math:`\sqrt{\sum_i V_i\,\Delta_i^2}`; the
     root-cause probes measured **pointwise / L∞**.  An error
     concentrated at the :math:`r \to 0` pole cell is loud in L∞ and
     near-silent in L2.
   - **(a) Sphere central-cell** :math:`\mathcal{O}(h)` **spatial
     closure (#233)** — L∞-only; :math:`\sim 75\,\%` an MMS
     midpoint-vs-shell-volume-average comparison artifact +
     :math:`\sim 25\,\%` genuine but **inherent** first order.  WONTFIX
     for diamond difference (Hébert §3.9.4 / Stacey §9.9 use plain
     diamond at the central cell).  See
     :ref:`sn-pole-cell-spatial-closure`.
   - **(b) Sphere angular** :math:`\tau`-**clamp floor** — fixed by W1
     (the clamp was mis-cited and 100 % spurious on physical fields).
     The sphere now uses the raw Bailey-Morel-Chang 2010 Eq. 43 weight.
     See :ref:`sn-tau-clamp-vindication`.
   - **(c) Cylinder angular floor (#229)** — the half-angle-thread
     INTERPOLATION floor; scales with the **azimuthal** quadrature
     :math:`n_\varphi`, structurally blocked (needs a 2-D
     :math:`(\eta, \varphi)` closure).  The sphere has a pre-floor
     :math:`\mathcal{O}(h^2)` window (clean at S32); the cylinder does
     **not** at any practical quadrature.  See
     :ref:`sn-cylinder-angular-floor`.
   - **Two unrelated "anisotropic" paths** (Issue #9): Path-(I) =
     geometric angular redistribution :math:`(1-\mu^2)/r\,\partial_\mu`
     (the M-M :math:`\alpha`-dome, P0-only — what #229 concerns);
     Path-(II) = :math:`P_1{+}` Legendre SCATTERING
     :math:`R\,\Lambda\,M` (geometry-agnostic).  See
     :ref:`sn-p1-scattering-curvilinear`.
   - **Norm gotcha**: a convergence-rate gate on a volume-weighted L2
     norm CANNOT see a pole-cell defect (the pole sits at one cell of
     :math:`V \sim h^3` → :math:`\sqrt{V} \sim h^{1.5}` →
     :math:`\sim h^{2.5}` contribution → subdominant).  A pointwise /
     L∞ probe is required to surface it.

This section closes the curvilinear-anisotropic-SN investigation
program (W1–W5, branch ``fix/curvilinear-aniso-pole-and-clamp``,
2026-06-13).  It is the sequel to the ERR-058 / #195 / #196 curvilinear
*isotropic* closure-seed family above; that family fixed the
wrong-fixed-point class (now formally retired), and what remained was
the *anisotropic* floor — which this program resolved into three
distinct, separately-actionable errors.

The headline — one floor was three errors, settled by a norm difference
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The ERR-058 close-out (above) deferred a residual "anisotropic angular
floor" to Issue #229, citing a single
:ref:`floor table <sn-err-058-aniso-floor>`.  The W1–W5 root-cause
program found that the apparent single floor was **three structurally
distinct errors**, and the reason they had been conflated is a **norm
difference** in how two independent investigations measured the same
solves:

* The verification gates (test-architect) measure the **volume-weighted
  L2** norm :math:`\|\Delta\|_{2,V} = \sqrt{\sum_i V_i\,\Delta_i^2}` —
  the natural norm for a finite-volume scheme whose unknown is a
  cell-volume average.
* The diagnostic probes (numerics-investigator) measured **pointwise /
  L∞** — :math:`\max_i |\Delta_i|`.

The two norms weight the :math:`r \to 0` pole cell completely
differently.  Under the spherical volume weight :math:`V \sim h^3`, a
fixed pointwise error at the single pole cell contributes
:math:`\sqrt{V} \sim h^{1.5}` to the L2 sum, so an L∞-:math:`\mathcal{O}(h)`
pole error appears as :math:`\sim h^{2.5}` in L2 — **subdominant to the
interior** :math:`\mathcal{O}(h^2)`, hence invisible.  This is exactly
why the production L2 gate stayed green throughout while a pointwise
probe found a first-order pole cell.

.. _sn-tau-clamp-vindication:

(b) The :math:`\tau`-clamp vindication (W1)
-------------------------------------------

The spherical Morel--Montry weighted-diamond weight is

.. math::
   :label: sn-tau-mm-raw

   \tau_n^{\rm raw}
       \;=\; \frac{\mu_n - \mu_{n-1/2}}{\mu_{n+1/2} - \mu_{n-1/2}}
       \;\in\; [0, 1],

the **unique** weight exact for an angular flux linear in :math:`\mu`
([BaileyMorelChang2010]_ Eq. 43; the same object as
:eq:`mm-weights`).  The production code had wrapped it in a
:math:`[\tfrac12, 1]` clamp,
:math:`\tau_n = \mathrm{clip}(\tau_n^{\rm raw}, \tfrac12, 1)`, cited
to Lewis & Miller §4.5.

W1 established, by three independent lines of evidence, that the clamp
is **mis-cited and 100 % spurious on physical fields**:

#. **Literature.** [BaileyMorelChang2010]_ state the admissible range
   is :math:`\tau \in [0, 1]` and recommend *exactly* the unclamped
   :math:`\tau^{\rm raw}` (their Eq. 43) as the unique exact-on-linear
   weight; Hébert §3.9.4 uses pure diamond (:math:`\tau = \tfrac12`),
   no clamp.  Lewis & Miller §4.5 does **not** prescribe the
   :math:`[\tfrac12, 1]` clamp — the citation was wrong.
#. **Positivity is never needed.** On every realistic converged solve
   (smooth MMS, homogeneous eigenvalue :math:`k_{\rm eff} = 1`, thick
   absorber) there are ZERO negative half-angle fluxes, clamped or
   unclamped — every clamp activation is spurious (measured: 160 / 320
   / 80 / 240 activations across stress configs, 0 protective).  The
   half-flux negativity that *does* transiently appear in early SI
   iterates is inherited from a negative *input* :math:`\psi` and the
   clamp barely reduces it.  On Gauss--Legendre quadrature
   :math:`\tau^{\rm raw} \in [0.39, 0.61]` (never 0), so the unclamped
   weight is always interior to :math:`[0, 1]`.
#. **Stability without it.** Unclamped sphere source iteration
   converges with strictly positive, finite scalar flux on every
   stress config (thick absorber, near-vacuum, :math:`c = 0.999`, S64);
   the clamp costs a few SI iterations on low-scattering problems but is
   dispensable for stability.

.. admonition:: The architectural reason the static removal is correct
   :class: note

   A *dynamic* negative-flux fixup (where :math:`\tau` depends on the
   iterate :math:`\psi`) would make the streaming operator
   **nonlinear**, breaking the linear-Krylov matvec and the SI ≡ Krylov
   twin identity (Pattern-2 discipline, Cardinal Rule 2).  Because the
   fixup is *never needed* on physical fields, the principled W1 fix is
   to **drop the clamp** (a config-time, static change) and use the
   linear unclamped :math:`\tau^{\rm raw}`.  The weight :math:`\tau` is
   single-sourced in the pole-angular closure
   (:func:`~orpheus.sn.sweep.pole_angular_closure.morel_montry_tau_per_level`,
   since Issue #236 Step C — see :ref:`sn-tau-c-on-cellvisit-live`) and
   inherited by every consumer (the SI sweep and the Krylov matvec
   both), so both twins stay linear and stay identical.

**Geometry split.**  W1 removed the clamp for the **sphere only**.  The
**cylinder keeps** it: product / level-symmetric quadratures place the
most-inward azimuthal ordinate exactly on :math:`\eta = -\sin\theta`,
giving :math:`\tau^{\rm raw} = 0` **exactly** (bit-exact, not "near
zero") — an unclamped recurrence divides by zero there.  This is a
genuine *structural* singularity the sphere provably lacks; the
cylinder's real fix is a 2-D :math:`(\eta, \varphi)` closure
(:ref:`sn-cylinder-angular-floor`), not unclamping.  See
:eq:`morel-montry-clamp` in :doc:`/theory/foundations/structured_geometry` for the
equation-of-record carrying both branches.

**Mixed accuracy signature (the gotcha).**  Unclamping does NOT
uniformly improve the anisotropic solve.  It *cleans the coarse
convergence rate* (sphere S16 coarse orders 1.978 → 1.995) but *raises
the S16 fine-mesh floor* (:math:`7.3\mathrm{e}{-4} \to 1.2\mathrm{e}{-3}`):

The lower *clamped* floor was a **fortuitous cancellation**, not a
genuine accuracy gain — the clamp's constant bias happened to partly
offset the angular-thread interpolation floor at S16.  Removing it
exposes the true #229 floor (next subsection), which is what the
unclamped weight should converge to.  Iso solves are unchanged in real
arithmetic (the clamp is silent on flat-in-:math:`\mu` fields) but
**not bit-identical** at IEEE-754: the closure
:math:`(\overline\psi - (1-\tau)\psi_{\rm in})/\tau` returns
:math:`\psi` exactly only :math:`\sim 81\,\%` of the time and within
1 ULP otherwise (reduction-order non-associativity), so the converged
homogeneous-reflective sphere drifts :math:`|\Delta k| = 2.3\mathrm{e}{-13}`,
:math:`\max|\Delta\phi| = 4.4\mathrm{e}{-13}` — an FP-tail, anchored to
the closed-form :math:`k_\infty = 1.875`.  One snapshot
(``sphere_2g_3reg_dd_n40``, genuinely non-flat) was regenerated
(:math:`k\;1.380766 \to 1.381001`); the two flat snapshots drift only
in the FP tail and were not regenerated.

.. _sn-cylinder-angular-floor:

(c) The cylinder angular floor (#229) — structurally blocked
------------------------------------------------------------

The anisotropic ansatz :math:`\psi_{\rm chosen} = (A(r) + B(r)\,\mu)/W`
imposes :math:`\psi_n` per ordinate, so there is **no angular error at
the imposed ordinates**.  But the M-M redistribution consumes
half-angle THREAD values :math:`\psi_{m\pm 1/2}` that the recurrence
**interpolates** (they are not imposed).  On an angle-varying ansatz the
thread's interpolation error is an angular-quadrature-resolution effect:
under spatial refinement at fixed quadrature the solution converges to
an angular floor, and a pure-spatial-rate assertion cannot hold once
the spatial error drops below it.

**The cylinder floor scales with the AZIMUTHAL quadrature**
:math:`n_\varphi`, **not the polar** :math:`n_\mu`.  This is the
load-bearing physical fact (and a correction to an earlier mislabel):
the radial direction cosine is :math:`\eta = \sin\theta\,\cos\varphi`,
so the M-M thread marches in azimuth :math:`\varphi` *per polar
:math:`\mu`-level*.  Measured at :math:`n_x = 80`:

.. list-table:: Cylinder aniso floor vs azimuthal quadrature (:math:`n_x = 80`, volume-weighted L2)

     - drops :math:`2.58\times`
   * - 32
     - 3.10e-3
     - drops :math:`2.38\times`

while :math:`n_\mu` (polar) refinement at fixed :math:`n_\varphi`
leaves the floor **flat**.

**Why it is structurally blocked.**  Product and level-symmetric
quadratures carry **duplicate azimuthal** :math:`\eta`: ordinates come
in :math:`\pm\varphi` symmetry pairs with the same :math:`|\eta|` but
opposite :math:`\xi` (e.g. :math:`\varphi = \pi/4` and
:math:`\varphi = 7\pi/4` both give
:math:`\eta = \sin\theta/\sqrt 2`).  The M-M thread marches in
:math:`\eta` alone, so a field whose true variation is in the full
:math:`(\eta, \varphi)` plane is **not threadable exactly** by a 1-D
:math:`\eta`-march — a structural mismatch, not a tuning problem.  No
partition (midpoint / cumulative-weight / ordinate-interior) gives
:math:`\tau^{\rm raw} \in [\tfrac12, 1]` with bounded edges; the
cumulative-weight partition is exact on level-symmetric but needs
:math:`\tau^{\rm raw} \in [-4.5, 5.5]` (edges outside the level).
Closing the cylinder floor requires a genuine 2-D
:math:`(\eta, \varphi)` angular closure — **out of scope**, tracked by
`Issue #229 <https://github.com/deOliveira-R/ORPHEUS/issues/229>`_.

**The sphere–cylinder asymmetry.**  The sphere DOES have a pre-floor
:math:`\mathcal{O}(h^2)` window: at S16 the coarse orders clear 1.99 and
the floor (:math:`\approx 2.9\mathrm{e}{-4}` at S32, :math:`n_x = 160`)
sits below the segment's finest spatial error, so the clean
second-order window extends to :math:`n_x = 80` at S32.  The cylinder
has **no** such window at *any* practical quadrature — even
:math:`n_\mu = 16` (:math:`N = 512`) reaches only order 1.80 on the
coarsest :math:`\{5, 10, 20\}` segment before the angular floor
dominates.  The mathematics, not runtime, is the blocker.

**W3 gate retune (Issue #229).**  Per the vv-principles anti-pattern
"a claim that cannot hold MUST NOT be asserted; pin what IS true
instead", W3 removed all five aniso xfail markers and migrated the six
equation labels to green tests:

* **Sphere** ``test_sn_spherical_aniso_mms_converges_second_order`` →
  coarse-segment ``orders[:2] > 1.9`` + magnitude band
  :math:`1\mathrm{e}{-8} < \mathrm{err}[-1] < 5\mathrm{e}{-3}`
  (loosened from :math:`1\mathrm{e}{-3}` because the W1 unclamp removed
  the fortuitous-cancellation lower floor) + ``catches("ERR-026")``.
* **Cylinder** ``test_sn_cylindrical_aniso_mms_converges_second_order``
  → floor band :math:`1\mathrm{e}{-3} < \mathrm{err}[-1] <
  5\mathrm{e}{-2}`, **no rate claim** (the floor dominates).  The
  cylinder phase-C spatial test was **repurposed** into
  ``test_cyl_aniso_floor_scales_with_quadrature``
  (:math:`\mathrm{err}(n_\varphi{=}16) < \mathrm{err}(n_\varphi{=}8)/2`
  — the verified-floor second claim that pins the angular attribution).
* The sphere prescribed-inflow redistribution test dropped its
  strict-xfail and rate gate (band :math:`1\mathrm{e}{-8} <
  \mathrm{err} < 5\mathrm{e}{-3}` + a kept converged-value
  ``assert_allclose(2e-2)``).

Landed in commit ``679a1e6`` (audit exit 0; the
:eq:`sn-mms-spherical-psi` / ``-qext`` / :eq:`sn-mms-cylindrical-psi` /
``-qext`` labels and the two spatial-convergence labels are now all
green-tested).

.. _sn-pole-cell-spatial-closure:

(a) The sphere/cylinder pole-cell :math:`\mathcal{O}(h)` spatial closure (#233, ERR-059)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the **new** discovery of the program and the one *surviving*
manifestation in the curvilinear-SN family.  The curvilinear scalar
flux is **first-order** :math:`\mathcal{O}(h)` at the :math:`r \to 0`
central cell in the pointwise / L∞ norm — distinct from #168 (outer
face, CLOSED), ERR-058 (the closure seed, CLOSED), and the angular
floors above.  It decomposes into three parts, **none** of which
warrants a code fix.

Decomposition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Part 1 — :math:`\sim 75\,\%` MMS comparison artifact (not a solver
bug at all).**  The production spherical MMS evaluates the source at the
cell MIDPOINT ``mesh.centers`` and compares
:math:`\phi_{\rm solver}` against :math:`\phi_{\rm exact}(\text{midpoint})`.
But the spherical DD discrete unknown **IS** the cell-volume average

.. math::
   :label: sn-pole-cell-shell-average

   \overline{\phi}_{n,i}
       \;=\; \frac{4\pi}{V_i}\int_{r_{i-1/2}}^{r_{i+1/2}} r^2\,\phi_n(r)\,dr

([Hebert2009]_ Eq. 3.430 — the unknown is *defined* as the shell
average, not a point value; the diamond relation Eq. 3.431 relates it to
the face fluxes).  Under :math:`r^2\,dr` weighting the volume-average and
the midpoint point-value differ by :math:`\mathcal{O}(h)` at the pole
cell, because :math:`r_{\rm lo} = 0` maximally skews the weight (the
volume-centroid sits at :math:`\tfrac34 h`, not :math:`\tfrac12 h`).
Using the *shell-averaged* source AND comparing against the
*shell-volume-average* drops the pole error :math:`\sim 4\times`
(:math:`0.0212 \to 0.00497`) — confirming the bulk of the apparent
error is a comparison subtlety, not solver truncation.

**Part 2 — :math:`\sim 25\,\%` genuine but LITERATURE-ACCEPTED INHERENT
first order.**  Even the fully consistent finite-volume MMS (shell-avg
source + shell-avg reference) leaves the pole at clean
:math:`\mathcal{O}(h^{1.00})`.  The root cause: at :math:`r_{\rm lo} = 0`
the inner face area :math:`A(0) = 0`, so the diamond closure
:math:`\overline\psi = \tfrac12(\psi_{\rm in} + \psi_{\rm out})` gives
:math:`\psi_{\rm out} = 2\overline\psi`, **over-predicting the pole
outer face by exactly +50 %** (mesh-independent rel. error 0.5000), while
the true face is :math:`A(h)` and :math:`2\langle A\rangle_{\rm vol} =
2\cdot\tfrac34 A(h) = 1.5\,A(h)`.  Deeper still, the conservative
*balance itself* is inconsistent at the pole: fed the EXACT cell average
and EXACT inflow it solves for an outer face :math:`-46\,\%` wrong, and
the residual-per-volume plateaus mesh-independently — because
:math:`A_{\rm in} = 0` degenerates the streaming surface integral while
:math:`V \sim h^3`.

[Hebert2009]_ §3.9.4 and Stacey §9.9 **both** use exactly this plain
diamond + Carlson-starting-direction + symmetry scheme at the central
cell with **no special** :math:`\mathcal{O}(h^2)` **closure, and
neither flags reduced order there**.  First-order at the single pole
cell is the accepted, unflagged behaviour of the standard scheme.

**Part 3 — NOT cleanly fixable by a local closure.**  W2 tested the
volume-weighted linear reconstruction
:math:`\overline\psi = \beta\,\psi_{\rm out} + (1-\beta)\,\psi_{\rm in}`
with :math:`\beta = \tfrac34` at the pole (the value that makes
:math:`\overline\psi` :math:`\mathcal{O}(h^3)`-consistent against
:math:`\langle A\rangle_{\rm vol}` at exact faces).  Validated
end-to-end with a faithful production-sweep monkeypatch (and a
:math:`\beta = \tfrac12`-identity regression guard verified to
:math:`3\mathrm{e}{-16}`): :math:`\beta = \tfrac34` does **NOT** restore
:math:`\mathcal{O}(h^2)` — the pole stays :math:`\mathcal{O}(h)`,
magnitude slightly *worse* (:math:`0.0050 \to 0.0106`), and a full-mesh
:math:`\beta` degrades the interior.  Closure-consistency at exact faces
:math:`\neq` fixed-point accuracy: the propagated face flux couples back
through the balance.  A genuine fix needs a non-local higher-order
central-cell reconstruction the canon does not provide — a linear-
discontinuous (Issue #6), cell-update (#158), or nodal scheme
([WuXieFischer1999]_ NSE 133).

Why it is invisible to L2 and to :math:`k_{\rm eff}`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The production ``test_sn_spherical_mms_converges_second_order`` uses the
volume-weighted L2 norm.  The pole :math:`\mathcal{O}(h)` at one cell of
:math:`V \sim h^3` contributes :math:`\sqrt V \sim h^{1.5}` →
:math:`h^{2.5}` to L2 — subdominant.  Both midpoint and volume-average
L2 references converge clean :math:`\mathcal{O}(h^{2.00})`; only the L∞
(pole) is :math:`\mathcal{O}(h)`.  For :math:`k_{\rm eff}`: a reflective
sphere recovers :math:`k_\infty = 1.875` exactly, mesh-independent; a
vacuum sphere converges monotone to :math:`\sim 1.78590` at
:math:`\mathcal{O}(h^{1.48})` (combined pole + outer-face first order;
increments :math:`2\mathrm{e}{-5}` at :math:`n_x = 160`, far below
engineering tolerance).  **This is why #233 needed an L∞ / per-cell
probe to surface** — no L2 or eigenvalue gate could see it.

The cylinder shares the same defect, masked
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The cylinder pole vs. **midpoint** is :math:`\mathcal{O}(h^2)`
(1.94 / 1.97 / 1.98) but vs. the **volume average** is
:math:`\mathcal{O}(h)` (0.99 / 0.99 / 1.00) — the SAME diamond
inconsistency, masked by the midpoint comparison: the cylinder's
:math:`r\,dr` (linear) weight puts the volume-centroid at
:math:`\tfrac23 h` while diamond's :math:`\tfrac12 A(h)` happens to
:math:`\approx` the midpoint :math:`A(h/2)`, so the midpoint comparison
the gate uses is *accidentally* :math:`\mathcal{O}(h^2)` for the
cylinder.  The cylinder pole is therefore **not** "clean
:math:`\mathcal{O}(h^2)`" — it is the same :math:`\mathcal{O}(h)`
volume-average defect, hidden by the comparison choice.  Cylinder global
L2 is also clean :math:`\mathcal{O}(h^{2.00})`.

The characterization gate (W2, #233)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Per the vv-principles "pin what is TRUE + protect the floor WITHOUT
calcifying the limitation" discipline, W2 ships a **characterization**
gate, not a fix gate
(``tests/sn/verification/mms/test_curvilinear_pole_cell_characterization.py``,
commit ``255eba4``):

* **Guarantee tests** (carry ``verifies("dd-curvilinear-scalar", ...)``,
  the :eq:`dd-curvilinear-scalar` cell-update label): global
  volume-weighted L2 is :math:`\mathcal{O}(h^2)` (``orders > 1.9``).
  The sphere is asserted under **both** references — midpoint AND the
  Hébert-3.430 shell-volume-average :eq:`sn-pole-cell-shell-average`,
  built from ``scipy.integrate.quad`` (a trusted-library integrator,
  structurally independent of the solver).  Agreement on the order
  across two structurally-different references proves the L2 order is
  REAL, not a midpoint artifact.
* **Characterization tests** (NO ``verifies`` — they pin a *limitation*,
  not a correctness claim): the pole L∞ order is **lower-bounded only**
  (:math:`> 0.8` — "at least first order, does not regress"), the pole
  is the L∞-dominant cell (fraction :math:`> 0.99`), and the interior
  is clean :math:`\mathcal{O}(h^2)` (:math:`> 1.8`).  **No upper bound**
  on the pole order, so a future LD / nodal scheme that lifts the pole
  to :math:`\mathcal{O}(h^2)` keeps the gate green
  (:math:`2.0 > 0.8`) — the characterization gate pins what is true and
  the regression floor without blocking a legitimate improvement
  (vv-principles anti-patterns #5 / #17).

Measured (sphere :math:`n_{\rm ord} = 16`, ladder
:math:`[40, 80, 160, 320]`): L2 midpoint orders :math:`2.01\times3`; L2
shell-average :math:`2.00\times3`; L∞ (pole) :math:`0.91 / 0.95 / 0.97`;
interior :math:`1.84 / 1.92 / 1.96`; pole fraction :math:`1.00` every
mesh.  Cylinder pole-vs-midpoint :math:`1.94 / 1.97 / 1.98`;
pole-vs-volavg :math:`0.99 / 0.99 / 1.00`.

.. _sn-p1-scattering-curvilinear:

Issue #9 — :math:`P_1` anisotropic SCATTERING in curvilinear (the two unrelated paths)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A persistent source of confusion in this cluster is that "anisotropic"
names **two structurally unrelated** things in a curvilinear SN solve.
Issue #9 is about the *second*; everything above (#229, the
:math:`\alpha`-dome, the :math:`\tau`-clamp) is about the *first*.

* **Path-(I) — geometric angular redistribution.**  The
  :math:`(1-\mu^2)/r\,\partial_\mu\psi` term (sphere) /
  :math:`\xi^2 B / r` (cylinder), threaded by the Morel--Montry Carlson
  :math:`\alpha`-dome.  This is **P0-only**; the "anisotropy" lives in
  the *angular-flux ansatz*, not in the scattering kernel.  The
  existing curvilinear aniso MMS cases
  (:math:`\psi = (A + \zeta B)/W`) exercise ONLY this path.  #229 is a
  Path-(I) test-design floor.
* **Path-(II) — Legendre SCATTERING moments.**  The
  :math:`P_1{+}` scattering source :math:`R\,\Lambda\,M`
  (``scattering.build_aniso_source``, ``scattering_order ≥ 1``),
  geometry-**agnostic**, wired identically for all geometries through
  :func:`~orpheus.sn.coupled_system.build_within_group_system` (the
  :math:`S` gain of the :math:`(L+C),\,S,\,B` decomposition carries
  :math:`P_1` when
  ``scattering_order = 1``).  No curvilinear test exercised Path-(II)
  before #9 — it is NEW coverage of an existing capability (NO
  ``orpheus/`` change; Path-(II) works as-is).

L0 — the operator-admits trick
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Rather than derive a costly symbolic :math:`P_1`-source MMS, W4 feeds a
*known* anisotropic angular flux :math:`\psi_{{\rm ref},n} = (A + \zeta
B)/W` to the within-group :math:`S` operator at
``scattering_order = 1`` and isolates the :math:`P_1` contribution as
:math:`S_1.\mathrm{apply}(\psi) - S_0.\mathrm{apply}(\psi)`, asserted
**per ordinate** (NOT weight-summed — the :math:`\alpha`-dome
telescopes, vv anti-pattern #8) against a structurally-independent
hand-reference:

* **Sphere** (fully SH-table-INDEPENDENT — :math:`P_1(\mu) = \mu`
  directly):

  .. math::
     :label: sn-p1-sphere-hand-ref

     q_n^{P_1} \;=\; \frac{1}{W}\,3\,\mu_n\,\Sigma_{s1}\,\phi_1,
     \qquad
     \phi_1 \;=\; B(r)\,\frac{\sum_n w_n\,\mu_n^2}{W}.

* **Cylinder** (explicit :math:`Y_1^m` moment-sum, independent of the
  production :math:`R\,\Lambda\,M` einsum):

  .. math::
     :label: sn-p1-cylinder-hand-ref

     q_n^{P_1} \;=\; \frac{1}{W}\,3\,\Sigma_{s1}
                  \sum_m Y_1^m(\Omega_n)\,\phi_1^m,
     \qquad
     \phi_1^m \;=\; \sum_n w_n\,Y_1^m(\Omega_n)\,\psi_n.

Both agree at machine precision (rel. :math:`4.7\mathrm{e}{-15}` sphere /
:math:`5.6\mathrm{e}{-15}` cylinder), with a
``max|S₁−S₀| > 1e-6`` negative control (vv anti-pattern #11 — a dropped
:math:`P_1` makes :math:`S_1 - S_0 \equiv 0` and fails the non-zero
hand-ref match).  **1-group is legitimate here**: this is a
flux-shape / OPERATOR claim (the per-ordinate :math:`P_1` source reads
:math:`\phi_1`, flux-shape-dependent by construction), NOT an eigenvalue
claim — the 1-group-degeneracy rule applies only to *eigenvalue*
verification.

L1 — the directional eigenvalue
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Forward-peaked :math:`P_1` scattering (:math:`\bar\mu > 0`) **lowers**
:math:`k_{\rm eff}` versus :math:`P_0`.  The physics: positive
:math:`\bar\mu` preserves the forward direction, so in a finite,
vacuum-bounded sphere forward-preserved scattered neutrons are more
likely to cross the outer boundary → **enhanced leakage** → lower
:math:`k_{\rm eff}`.  This requires a **vacuum** outer BC (a reflective
sphere has no leakage → :math:`P_0 \equiv P_1`).  Validated robust:

* Homogeneous vacuum sphere :math:`R = 4 / 10 / 25`:
  :math:`\Delta = k_{\rm eff}^{P_1} - k_{\rm eff}^{P_0} =
  -3.76\mathrm{e}{-3} / -1.32\mathrm{e}{-3} / -2.88\mathrm{e}{-4}` — sign
  always negative, :math:`|\Delta|` **grows as the sphere shrinks**
  (the leakage-monotone signature, the structural negative control a
  sign-flipped or absorption-mimicking :math:`P_1` would violate).
* Heterogeneous fuel-core(:math:`r < 5`)+moderator-shell vacuum sphere
  :math:`R = 10`: :math:`\Delta = -1.40\mathrm{e}{-2}` (:math:`140\times`
  the :math:`1\mathrm{e}{-3}` detection bar), with materials
  ``get_mixture("A","2g")`` (the only fissile 2-group mixture;
  asymmetric downscatter-only P0 avoids the 1-group degeneracy) and
  ``get_mixture("C","2g")``.

Two L1 rows pin this: a heterogeneous-sphere
:math:`k_{\rm eff}^{P_1} < k_{\rm eff}^{P_0}` AND
:math:`1\mathrm{e}{-3} < (P_0 - P_1) < 5\mathrm{e}{-2}`; and a
leakage-monotone control
:math:`(P_0 - P_1)|_{R=4} > (P_0 - P_1)|_{R=25} > 0` (the mechanism
pin).  These are the **first curvilinear exercise** of the
geometry-agnostic ``pn-scatter`` / ``flux-moments`` labels (prior tests
were 2-D Cartesian only).  L0 lands in
``tests/sn/verification/mms/test_curvilinear_aniso_scattering_p1.py``,
L1 in ``tests/sn/eigenvalue/test_keff_curvilinear.py::TestSphereP1DirectionalEigenvalue``
(commit ``d5878e9``).  L2 is deferred (subsumed by L0+L1; a
:math:`P_1`-convergence L2 needs the :math:`\sigma_{s1}`-MMS source and
rides the same #229 floor).

     - **production**
     - Retained — the :math:`\tau^{\rm raw} = 0` structural
       :math:`\div 0` block; removing it needs a 2-D
       :math:`(\eta,\varphi)` closure (#229).
   * - Pole-cell characterization gate
     - **regression net**
     - Pins the inherent :math:`\mathcal{O}(h)` pole limitation

     - **oracle**
     - The Hébert-3.430 finite-volume unknown; the principled MMS

       artifact.  Built from ``scipy.integrate.quad``.

Open research paths (research-tag, not production-blocking)
-----------------------------------------------------------

#. **Higher-order central-cell spatial scheme** (lifts the #233 pole
   :math:`\mathcal{O}(h)`).  The canon ([Hebert2009]_ §3.9.4, Stacey
   §9.9) provides no drop-in :math:`\mathcal{O}(h^2)` central-cell
   diamond closure; the documented route is a non-local higher-order
   *spatial* scheme — linear-discontinuous (Issue #6), step-
   characteristic, or the Green's-function nodal method of
   [WuXieFischer1999]_ (NSE 133, "very high precision on coarse meshes
   relative to standard fine-mesh DD").  Likely diagnostic probe: the
   pole-cell per-cell rate under the shell-average reference, holding
   quadrature fixed.
#. **2-D** :math:`(\eta, \varphi)` **cylinder angular closure** (lifts
   the #229 cylinder floor).  The 1-D :math:`\eta`-thread cannot
   represent the duplicate-azimuthal-:math:`\eta` variation of product /
   level-symmetric quadratures; a genuine 2-D angular closure (or a
   Gauss-type azimuthal quadrature with distinct :math:`\eta` values,
   GitHub Issue #1) is required.  Likely probe: the floor-scaling table
   above with the azimuthal quadrature replaced by a distinct-:math:`\eta`
   set.

InvertibleOperator: the streaming-collision operator algebra
==============================================================

The streaming-collision loss composite :math:`L+C` — its operator
surface (``apply`` / ``solve`` / ``apply_transpose``), the one-walk
matvec ≡ sweep fact, reciprocity, and the typed carrier — is
documented in :doc:`slab_one_group` (:ref:`sn-streaming-operator`).
This section retains the historical record of the superseded
two-closure design (kept for the ERR-026 closure-bias reasoning it
records) and the scattering adjoint.

Apply and solve use **different** closures by design (historical)
-----------------------------------------------------------------

.. note:: **Superseded architecture (Wave D / early Wave E).**  This
   subsection describes a design in which ``apply`` (a separate
   finite-difference operator) and ``solve`` (the WDD sweep) were
   **two distinct discretisations** of :math:`A`.  That split was
   dissolved by the #206 Phase C **matvec ≡ sweep** unification: today
   ``apply`` and ``solve`` run the **one** loss-representation walk
   (:meth:`~orpheus.sn.loss_representation.LossRepresentation.loss_action`
   for the matvec, :meth:`~orpheus.sn.loss_representation.LossRepresentation.sweep`
   for the inverse — "one walk", a code fact per L21), so there is no
   longer a separate FD operator and no by-design bit-difference between
   the two directions.  The FD-operator family
   (``transport_operator_matvec*`` and its unified successor) was deleted
   in the typed-field (#197) and walk-unification (#280 campaigns)
   refactors.  The historical two-closure narrative below is retained for
   the ERR-026 closure-bias reasoning it records.

This was the load-bearing architectural fact about
:class:`InvertibleOperator`, and the reason the operator's
:meth:`apply` was **not** bit-identical to its :meth:`solve`.

The Wave-D-era SN dispatch in ORPHEUS shipped **two distinct
discretisations** of the same continuous operator
:math:`A = \Omega\cdot\nabla + \Sigma_t`, built at different times
for different consumers:

* The **finite-difference operator** (the ``transport_operator_matvec_*``
  family in :mod:`orpheus.sn.operators.streaming`, since deleted) was
  built for the BiCGSTAB inner
  solver path (:meth:`SNSolver._solve_bicgstab_*`).  It used
  upwind cell-center FD on Cartesian and arithmetic face averages
  with **τ-symmetric Morel-Montry angular interpolation** on
  curvilinear (see the "Explicit Transport Operator" subsection of
  the BiCGSTAB Alternative above and the warning at the head of
  :mod:`orpheus.sn.operators.streaming`).

* The **sweep operator**
  (:meth:`~orpheus.sn.operators.streaming.InvertibleOperator.solve`,
  dispatching its selected representation through the
  :class:`~orpheus.transport.spatial.scheme.DiscretizationScheme`
  Protocol with :class:`~orpheus.transport.spatial.diamond.DiamondDifference`
  as the default strategy) uses the **WDD asymmetric closure**
  :math:`\psi_{n+1/2} = (\overline\psi - (1-\tau)\,\psi_{n-1/2})/\tau`.
  This is the historical SN sweep's closure: the upper-triangular
  forward-substitution form that lets a sweep run in
  :math:`O(N\cdot N_{\rm cells})` work.

In the fine-mesh limit both discretisations converge to the same
continuous operator.  On coarse meshes they differ:

* For Cartesian the difference is :math:`O(h)` (upwind FD has
  the same first-order consistency as DD on uniform meshes;
  divergence appears on non-uniform meshes — see the warning at
  the head of :mod:`orpheus.sn.operators.streaming`).
* For curvilinear the WDD asymmetric closure has a closure-bias-
  driven self-consistent fixed point that is **not** the
  fine-mesh-limit transport solution (ERR-026).

The reconciliation is **Wave E Issue 15**: the SN solver's inner
loop migrates from "sweep with WDD closure" to "Krylov on apply,
sweep as preconditioner".  Krylov on :meth:`apply` uses the
symmetric closure (the one that agrees with analytical references)
as the system to solve; the WDD sweep is invoked only as a
preconditioner that accelerates the Krylov iteration without
poisoning the converged solution with its closure bias.  ERR-026
closes when Wave E lands; the 2 xfail-strict tripwires at
:file:`tests/sn/l1_analytical/test_mms_curvilinear_aniso_dd_convergence.py`
are the gating bug-catchers for that closure.

.. _sn-scattering-adjoint:

The scattering adjoint, free from the harmonic frame
----------------------------------------------------------

The streaming operator's analytic adjoint is hard (the subsection above):
sign-flipping the upwind direction, transposing the M–M closure, re-deriving
the per-level azimuthal redistribution — each an AI-failure-mode trap — so
:math:`A^*` is taken by the dense-transpose fallback.  The **scattering**
operator :math:`S` is the counterexample: campaign **#276 P3** (commit
``15185e5``, closes
`#118 <https://github.com/deOliveira-R/ORPHEUS/issues/118>`_) made
:math:`S^{T}` fall out **for free**, because :math:`S` is already written as
a harmonic-frame conjugation.

The modernised in-scatter source is ONE frame-conjugated operator
(:attr:`~orpheus.transport.operators.scattering.ScatteringOperator.full_scatter_kernel`):

.. math::

   \mathrm{full\_scatter\_kernel}
   \;=\; R \circ (\Lambda_{\ell\ge 0} + N_{2n}) \circ M ,

where :math:`M` / :math:`R` are the angular frame's analysis /
reconstruction faces, :math:`\Lambda_{\ell\ge 0}` is the per-:math:`\ell`
moment-space group transfer
(:class:`~orpheus.transport.operators.scattering.LegendreMomentScattering`),
and :math:`N_{2n}` is the distinct :math:`(n,2n)` multiplication channel
(:class:`~orpheus.transport.operators.scattering.N2NMomentOperator`) —
summed with :math:`\Lambda` in moment space and conjugated by the frame
*together* (one analysis, one reconstruction) for the WHOLE
P0 + :math:`\ell\ge1` + :math:`(n,2n)` source.  Its transpose is therefore
the product transpose

.. math::

   \mathrm{full\_scatter\_kernel}^{T}
   \;=\; M^{T} \circ (\Lambda + N_{2n})^{T} \circ R^{T},

which :meth:`OperatorProduct.apply_transpose
<orpheus.numerics.operator.OperatorProduct.apply_transpose>` assembles from
the leaf transposes — the frame's :math:`M^{T}` / :math:`R^{T}` faces (landed
in the Frame/Basis carve), the per-:math:`\ell` group transpose
:math:`\Lambda^{T}`, and :math:`N_{2n}^{T}` — with **no per-geometry
derivation to verify** (the trap the streaming adjoint above could not
avoid).  The per-ordinate adjoint scattering source is then

.. math::

   S^{T}\chi \;=\; \tfrac{1}{W}\,\mathrm{full\_scatter\_kernel}^{T}\,\chi ,

the producer-side :math:`1/W` transposing as the scalar it is
(:math:`(A/W)^{T} = A^{T}/W`).
:class:`~orpheus.transport.operators.scattering.ScatteringOperator` now
reports ``is_adjointable = True`` (it has a working ``apply_transpose``),
and the old "no ``apply_transpose``" class-docstring confession is
retired.

**Forward fast-path, adjoint frame-path — and why the asymmetry is
principled.**  The production FORWARD source keeps the scalar fast-path
(:attr:`~orpheus.transport.operators.scattering.ScatteringOperator.isotropic_kernel`
for P0 + :math:`(n,2n)`, and the per-:math:`\ell` ``build_aniso_source``)
for SI-sweep performance; the **adjoint** — not the hot path — rides the
validated frame form instead.  The two are thus structurally *different*
representations of the same operator, which is exactly what makes the
verification a genuine cross-check rather than a tautology: the per-group
Euclidean reciprocity
:math:`\langle S\psi, \chi\rangle = \langle\psi, S^{T}\chi\rangle`
(``tests/sn/operators/test_scattering_adjoint.py``,
``TestFullScatterKernel::test_S_euclidean_reciprocity``) pins the frame-form
:math:`S^{T}` against the *independent* scalar fast-path :math:`S`, and the
forward equivalence
:math:`(1/W)\,\mathrm{full\_scatter\_kernel}.\mathrm{apply} \equiv
S.\mathrm{apply}` holds to :math:`\sim 10^{-12}`.

.. note::

   This :math:`S^{T}` is the **Euclidean** transpose (the plain
   group-and-angle matvec adjoint), NOT the metric Hilbert adjoint
   :math:`S^{\dagger} = G^{-1}S^{T}G` — that angular-Gram weighting is the
   :attr:`~orpheus.numerics.operator.LinearOperator.H` wrapper's job.  The
   campaign and commit name it "S†" colloquially; the precise object the
   operator computes is the transpose.

This is the discrete scattering adjoint the SN adjoint chain builds on: the
adjoint flux :math:`\psi^{*}` solving :math:`(L+C-S)^{T}\psi^{*} = q^{*}`,
adjoint-weighted homogenisation, perturbation theory, and detector
sensitivity all need :math:`S^{T}`.  Its companion forward step (campaign
**#276 P2**, commit ``dcea43a``) routes the SN forward *isotropic* source
through the same model-shared
:class:`~orpheus.transport.operators.isotropic_scattering.IsotropicScattering`
(:math:`\Sigma_{s0}`) and
:class:`~orpheus.transport.operators.isotropic_scattering.IsotropicN2N`
(:math:`2\Sigma_{2n}`) operators (0-ULP bit-identical), so the
:math:`K_\mathrm{iso}` energy operator — which also assembles the
infinite-medium loss matrix (:ref:`direct-eigensolve-assembly`) — is one
cross-model source.  These model-shared operators live in
:mod:`orpheus.transport.operators`.


Wave E and beyond — landed and forward
--------------------------------------

* **Wave E Issue 14 lifted** the iteration primitives (power
  iteration, source iteration) into stand-alone operator-algebra
  consumers in :mod:`orpheus.numerics.iteration`, decoupling them
  from :class:`SNSolver`.
* **Wave E Issue 15 wired** :class:`SNSolver` to
  :class:`InvertibleOperator`: the inner solve becomes Krylov on
  :meth:`apply` with sweep as preconditioner, which removes the WDD
  asymmetric closure from the converged-solution path for the
  reflective-BC eigenvalue case.  Wave E Round 3 will extend the
  equation-map layout to the vacuum-BC path that closes ERR-026
  for fixed-source curvilinear MMS.
* **Forward**: when production reciprocity becomes performance-
  critical, an :math:`O(n)` analytic-adjoint matvec replaces the
  dense-transpose fallback; the new path is gated by the
  reciprocity tests in :file:`tests/sn/test_streaming_operator.py`
  (post-D-K successor) and :file:`tests/sn/test_phase_c_gates.py`
  Gate 1.3 (xfail pending Wave O).

.. _sn-solver-operator-algebra-coordinator:

SNSolver as an operator-algebra coordinator
============================================

:class:`~orpheus.sn.solver.SNSolver` consumes the operator triple
:math:`(A, S, F)` directly.  At construction time, the solver builds:

* :attr:`SNSolver.L` — :class:`InvertibleOperator` carrying the
  symmetric-closure streaming-collision operator.
* :attr:`SNSolver.S` — :class:`~orpheus.transport.operators.scattering.ScatteringOperator`
  carrying the P0 + (n,2n) + Pℓ Galerkin reconstruction (Wave D
  Issue 13).
* :attr:`SNSolver.F` — :class:`~orpheus.transport.operators.fission.FissionOperator`
  carrying the rank-1-in-energy fission emission (Wave D Issue 13).

Each of these is a :class:`~orpheus.numerics.operator.LinearOperator`
in the Wave A operator-algebra sense: predicate-typed, composable
under :class:`~orpheus.numerics.operator.OperatorSum` and
:class:`~orpheus.numerics.operator.OperatorProduct`, and protocol-
conforming so the iteration primitives in
:mod:`orpheus.numerics.iteration` consume them without SN-specific
plumbing.  The within-group inner solve is built once from a single
source of truth — the :func:`~orpheus.sn.coupled_system.build_within_group_system`
builder assembles the :class:`~orpheus.sn.coupled_system.WithinGroupSystem`
record, the honest within-group decomposition :math:`(L+C,\ S,\ B)` as a
named splitting :math:`A = M - N`: the invertible resolvent
:math:`M = (L+C)` plus its two lagged coupling gains :math:`N = (S,\ B_a)`
(the bulk scattering :math:`S` and the trace boundary reflection :math:`B`;
zero within-group fission), handed to the **variadic** driver
:math:`\text{Driver}(L_{\rm resolvent},\,*\text{gains})` (Wave O step
O.2a — the transitional :math:`S + B` fold is retired; see
:ref:`bc-extraction-variadic-driver` in :doc:`/theory/foundations/boundary_conditions`).
:func:`_within_group_krylov` wraps the matching
:class:`~orpheus.numerics.iteration.KrylovAcceleration` — and the
decomposition is shared verbatim across the eigenvalue source-iteration
inner (:meth:`SNSolver._solve_source_iteration`), the eigenvalue Krylov
inner (:meth:`SNSolver._solve_krylov`), and both fixed-source paths.

The within-group inner solve consumes the primitives directly
-------------------------------------------------------------

:class:`SNSolver`'s within-group inner solve **is** the
:class:`~orpheus.numerics.iteration.SourceIteration` /
:class:`~orpheus.numerics.iteration.KrylovAcceleration` primitive — not
a verbatim replica of its loop.
:meth:`SNSolver._solve_source_iteration` constructs a
:class:`SourceIteration` from the :func:`~orpheus.sn.coupled_system.build_within_group_system` SSoT and
runs it; :meth:`SNSolver._solve_krylov` constructs a
:class:`KrylovAcceleration` from :func:`_within_group_krylov` and runs
that.  The Layer-3 resolvent of the SN row in the
:ref:`eigenvalue-posing` architecture is exactly these primitive
instances.

The primitive is **type-agnostic and angular-capable**: it operates on
the typed :class:`~orpheus.transport.timed_full_field.TimedFullField`
composite, which carries the full angular flux on its bulk.  Pℓ
anisotropic scattering therefore rides the angular bulk with no special
plumbing — :meth:`ScatteringOperator.apply` on the timeless
:class:`~orpheus.transport.full_field.FullField` operator carrier (the
driver's :class:`~orpheus.transport.timed_full_field.TimedFullField` iterate
reaches it via MRO) reads the angular moments off the composite and builds
the anisotropic source via :meth:`ScatteringOperator.build_aniso_source`,
all inside the primitive's normal RHS path.  There is **no scalar-flux
limitation** and **no pending "Approach A" cleanup**: the earlier
framing — that :class:`SourceIteration` carried only scalar flux and SN
had to replicate the loop verbatim until the angular state could be
threaded through — was a property of an interim scalar-only carrier
that the typed composite retired.  The
``.claude/skills/algebra-of-record`` "Branch 2 implements the same
operator algebra" discipline is satisfied: SN is the discretized
Branch-2 consumer of the shared primitive, not a parallel loop.

The (L − S − F)·ψ = (1/k)·F·ψ framing at the solver level
-----------------------------------------------------------

Beyond driving the within-group inner solve, the :math:`(A, S, F)`
framing organises the solver's outer API surface:

* :meth:`SNSolver.compute_fission_source` returns
  :math:`F\,\phi/k` — a thin delegator to :meth:`F.apply` with the
  :math:`1/k` outer-loop scaling applied at the solver level.
* :meth:`SNSolver.solve_fixed_source` solves
  :math:`(A - S)\,\psi = q_{\rm ext}` (with :math:`q_{\rm ext}` the
  fission source built by ``compute_fission_source``).  Two paths:

  * ``inner_solver="source_iteration"`` — sweep-driven fixed-point
    iteration; :math:`A^{-1}` is the WDD asymmetric sweep.  ERR-026-
    affected for curvilinear vacuum-BC cases.
  * ``inner_solver="krylov"`` — GMRES on :meth:`A.apply` with the
    sweep as preconditioner.  Reflective-BC equation map only
    (Round 3 owns the vacuum-BC extension).

* :meth:`SNSolver.compute_keff` returns **fission production over net
  removal**, :eq:`sn-keff-update` — the volume-weighted method-layer
  functional :math:`R_{\nu\Sigma_f}(\phi) / (R_{\Sigma_a}(\phi) + L -
  E_{2n}(\phi))`, derived in :ref:`sn-keff-estimator` below.  The
  SN-specific volume weighting lives here (in the typed
  :class:`~orpheus.transport.reaction_rate_functional.IntegratedReactionRate`
  fields) — one honest realization of the same discipline the
  operator-form :meth:`KEigenvalue.compute_keff` spells with the
  measure absorbed into the operators' action.  (Pre-#291 this method
  returned the leakage-blind :math:`\sum F\phi V / \sum \Sigma_a\phi V`
  ratio; see :ref:`sn-keff-estimator` for why that was a
  non-eigenvalue on any vacuum-bounded problem.)

The solver-level :math:`1/k` scaling (in
:meth:`~SNSolver.compute_fission_source`) and the volume-weighted
eigenvalue estimate (in :meth:`~SNSolver.compute_keff`) are exactly the
points where SN's specifics live; the rest of the solver is
operator-algebra coordination over the canonical
:func:`~orpheus.numerics.eigenvalue.power_iteration` boundary.  These
two K-specific hooks are also precisely *why* the Layer-4 loop is not
yet literally K/α-agnostic — relocating the eigenvalue scaling into the
algorithm is the first step of the α-wave (see the honest-scope caveat
in :ref:`eigenvalue-posing`).

The eigenvalue :math:`\keff` is determined by **power iteration**: an
outer loop updates :math:`k` from the net-removal balance
:eq:`sn-keff-update` (fission production over absorption + leakage −
:math:`(n,2n)` emission), with an inner loop that solves the
within-group scattering problem.

.. _sn-keff-estimator:

The reported eigenvalue: fission production over net removal
------------------------------------------------------------

:meth:`~orpheus.sn.solver.SNSolver.compute_keff` reports the eigenvalue
of the problem the inner solve **actually poses**.  This is the SN
symptom (#291) and the MoC/CP/homogeneous root (#259) of a single
discipline: *the reported* :math:`k` *must be the eigenvalue of the
fixed-source map every method scales only fission by* :math:`1/k`
*through* — scattering and the :math:`(n,2n)` emission are plain gains
assembled **inside** :meth:`~orpheus.sn.solver.SNSolver.solve_fixed_source`,
never scaled by :math:`1/k`.  An estimator that disagrees with its own
posed problem converges cleanly and silently to a **non-eigenvalue
ratio**.

.. math::
   :label: sn-keff-update

   k \;=\; \frac{R_{\nu\Sigma_f}(\phi)}
                {R_{\Sigma_a}(\phi) \;+\; L \;-\; E_{2n}(\phi)}

.. (vv-status rationale) Governing/definitional identity: the reported k
   IS the eigenvalue of the posed fixed-source map, not a solver
   eigenvalue-correctness claim against an external analytical reference
   (that rests on the multi-group heterogeneous L1/L2 references
   elsewhere on this page). The verifiable content is the cross-engine
   consistency gate tests/sn/eigenvalue/test_keff_estimator_gate.py
   (reported k == the converged fixed-point map ratio k* = P(Mφ*)/P(φ*),
   map-ratio ground-truth noise ≤ 2e-11) with in-file mutation teeth.
   Wiring @pytest.mark.verifies("sn-keff-update") onto that gate is a
   test-side follow-up (this docs pass could not touch tests/).
.. vv-status: sn-keff-update documented

The three terms are typed volume-integrated reaction-rate functionals
and one boundary functional:

* **Numerator** :math:`R_{\nu\Sigma_f}(\phi) = \int_V \nu\Sigma_f\,\phi\,dV`
  — the fission production, the typed
  :class:`~orpheus.transport.reaction_rate_functional.IntegratedReactionRate`
  over :math:`\nu\Sigma_f` (the :math:`\phi^\dagger\!=\!1` degenerate of
  the homogenization Petrov–Galerkin bilinear).  The :math:`(n,2n)`
  emission is **not** production here — contrast
  :meth:`~orpheus.sn.solver.SNSolver.compute_production_rate`, the
  ERR-052 renormalisation scale anchor, which keeps *total* physical
  production (fission **plus** the :math:`(n,2n)` emission).  The role
  split is the load-bearing #259 correction: the same physical
  :math:`(n,2n)` neutrons are a **scale** quantity for the outer
  renormalisation but a **removal-reduction** in the eigenvalue balance.
* **Absorption** :math:`R_{\Sigma_a}(\phi) = \int_V \Sigma_a\,\phi\,dV`,
  with :math:`\Sigma_a = \Sigma_f + \Sigma_c + \Sigma_L +
  \sum_{g'}\Sigma_{2,g\to g'}` — i.e. ``absorption_xs`` counts the
  :math:`(n,2n)` **collision once** (the neutron is removed from its
  incident group by the collision).  See
  :attr:`~orpheus.data.macro_xs.mixture.Mixture.absorption_xs`.
* **Leakage** :math:`L` — the net vacuum-boundary outflow (below).  On a
  reflective (lattice) problem it is a **structural zero**.
* **Emission** :math:`E_{2n}(\phi) = \int_V \sum_{g,g'} 2\,\Sigma_{2,g'\to
  g}\,\phi_{g'}\,dV` — the :math:`(n,2n)` **emission** (two neutrons out
  per collision; the factor 2).  A gain, so it **reduces** net removal.

The net :math:`(n,2n)` effect on removal is therefore
:math:`\underbrace{\sum_{g'}\Sigma_{2,g\to g'}}_{\text{collision, in }\Sigma_a}
- \underbrace{2\Sigma_2}_{E_{2n}} = -\Sigma_2` — **one extra neutron
gained** per collision, exactly the physics of a neutron-doubling
reaction.

**Balance identity (divergence-telescoping).**  The angle- and
group-summed discrete cell balance for cell :math:`i` in the posed
eigenproblem is

.. math::

   \underbrace{\sum_{f\in\partial i}\!\bigl(\textstyle\sum_g J_g\bigr)\,\Delta A_f}
              _{\text{net face flow}}
   \;+\; \Sigma_{t,i}\,\phi_i\,V_i
   \;=\; \frac{1}{k}\,R_{\nu\Sigma_f,i}
        \;+\; \Sigma_{s,i}\,\phi_i\,V_i
        \;+\; E_{2n,i}

(streaming + total collision on the left; the isotropic fission source
scaled by :math:`1/k`, plus the *unscaled* scatter and :math:`(n,2n)`
gains, on the right).  Summing over **all** cells, every interior face
is shared by two cells with opposite outward normals and equal current
(continuity), so the interior face-flow terms **telescope to zero** —
only the domain-boundary faces survive, and their sum is the net
leakage :math:`L`.  With :math:`\Sigma_t - \Sigma_s = \Sigma_a` this
collapses to

.. math::

   \frac{R_{\nu\Sigma_f}(\phi)}{k} \;=\; R_{\Sigma_a}(\phi) \;+\; L
                                        \;-\; E_{2n}(\phi),

which is :eq:`sn-keff-update` rearranged.  This is the same discrete
divergence discipline the diffusion page states as
:math:`\mathbf 1^{\mathsf T}(C-S)=\Sigma_a` with interior-face
telescoping (see :ref:`diffusion-leakage-boundary-leaves`); SN and
diffusion report the *same* balance-law eigenvalue, differing only in
how the streaming operator is discretised.

The leakage functional
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. math::

   L \;=\; \sum_{f\,\in\,\text{vacuum}} \oint_{f} dA\,
           \sum_g J_g(\mathbf{r}_f)\,,
   \qquad
   J_g \;=\; \sum_m (\Omega_m\cdot\hat n_f)\, w_m\, \psi_{m,g}

is the face-area integral of the boundary trace's **net outward
current**.  The angular-to-scalar reduction :math:`J_g` is
:meth:`AngularBoundaryFlux.net_current
<orpheus.transport.fields.angular_boundary_flux.AngularBoundaryFlux.net_current>`
— the single source of the :math:`\Omega\cdot\hat n\,w` contraction, the
angular sibling of the scalar trace's :math:`J = J^+ - J^-`
(:meth:`ScalarBoundaryFlux.net_current
<orpheus.transport.fields.scalar_boundary_flux.ScalarBoundaryFlux.net_current>`).
It is spelled through the trace space's own atoms — the signed
projection table
:attr:`~orpheus.numerics.spaces.angular_trace_space.AngularTraceSpace.omega_dot_n`
and the :math:`|\Omega\cdot\hat n|\odot w` partial-current metric (using
the identity :math:`\operatorname{sign}(\Omega\cdot\hat n)\cdot
|\Omega\cdot\hat n|\,w = \Omega\cdot\hat n\,w`) — so no consumer
re-derives the cosine weighting.  Tangential ordinates carry zero weight
and drop out.

The face measure :math:`dA` is supplied by
:meth:`SNSolver._face_area_of`, matching the cell
``volume_measure`` exactly so the balance identity closes:

.. list-table:: Boundary-face measure by geometry

       (transverse-area outer product)
     - ``mesh.axes`` transverse extents

The :math:`d \ge 2` Cartesian arms are ONE generic body: the outer
product of the *other* axes' edge widths in **ascending axis order** —
the same codimension-1 enumeration as
:func:`~orpheus.transport.mesh.axis.face_shape`, so the measure array
broadcasts cell-for-cell against the ``(ng, *face_spatial)`` net
current, and the 2-D width vector is just the single-transverse-axis
degenerate (bit-identical to the pre-3-D spelling).

The 3-D arm originally shipped as a **typed refusal**
(``NotImplementedError``): guessing the transverse product's cell
ordering would silently mis-weight the leakage sum, and Cardinal Rule 1
forbids returning a wrong-but-plausible number.  The wire landed
2026-07-13 when the first 3-D vacuum eigenvalue consumer arrived (the
d=3 Mode-9 G-S≡Jacobi gate), with the ordering pinned twice in
``tests/sn/eigenvalue/test_keff_estimator_gate.py``: an **object-level
pin** (face measure ≡ the boundary layer's ``volumes / Δ_axis``, the
mesh's own ascending-axis enumeration — vv Mode-12 discipline: pin the
object, not only the k functional) and the **k* map-ratio gate** on a
Mode-2 asymmetric all-vacuum box, whose teeth are proven by permanent
in-process mutants — a reversed transverse enumeration moves the
reported k by a measured **13.9 %** against the estimator-independent
:math:`k^*` (clean agreement :math:`6\times10^{-10}`), and a transposed
enumeration crash-REDs on the broadcast.  A trace carrying a
``#251`` transverse face-moment tail is refused loudly at the
consumption site (the face integral must consume ONLY the
transverse-average moment — higher Legendre face moments integrate to
zero over each face cell — and that slot-0 read has no consumer yet).

Reflective faces are a structural zero
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The reflective law equates a face's inflow to its reflected outflow
**exactly**, so the net current there vanishes *by construction*.
:meth:`~orpheus.sn.solver.SNSolver._boundary_leakage_rate` therefore
**skips** reflective faces — it never accumulates them, rather than
accumulating a value that ought to be zero but carries
:math:`\pm`-cancelling angular-sum floating-point noise.

This is a deliberate design choice with a bit-level payoff.  On an
all-reflective (lattice) problem :math:`L` is a structural ``0.0``, and
on a :math:`\Sigma_2`-free mixture :math:`E_{2n}` is exactly ``0.0`` (the
per-material :math:`(n,2n)` loop adds nothing), so
:eq:`sn-keff-update` reduces **bit-identically** to the historical
lattice functional ``production / absorption``.  Every pre-existing
reflective eigenvalue anchor is preserved to the last ULP — the
unification adds terms that vanish structurally, not numerically, on the
cases it must not perturb.

The scale bridge: trace of the last inner solve
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The leakage term reads the **typed** boundary trace of the last inner
solve (``self._psi_typed.boundary``), whereas the numerator/denominator
reaction rates consume the bare-array flux :math:`\phi` the estimator is
handed.  These two representations can be at **different scales**:
:func:`~orpheus.numerics.eigenvalue.power_iteration` renormalises
:math:`\phi` to unit production rate *between* the inner solve and the
:math:`k`-update (ERR-052), so the stored trace belongs to the
**un-renormalised** last iterate while the estimator's :math:`\phi` is
its renormalised multiple.

Leakage is degree-1 homogeneous in :math:`\psi`, so the fix is a single
rescale by the fission-production ratio of the two fluxes
(``self._phi_of_trace``, stored alongside the trace at **both**
inner-path returns) — exactly ``1.0`` when the caller passes the
returned flux itself.  The **contract** is therefore: the flux handed to
:meth:`~orpheus.sn.solver.SNSolver.compute_keff` must be a scalar
multiple of the last inner solve's flux (true for ``power_iteration`` and
for every manual solve-then-estimate loop).

If a vacuum face exists but **no** inner solve has stored a trace,
:meth:`~orpheus.sn.solver.SNSolver._boundary_leakage_rate` raises
``RuntimeError`` — the leakage cannot be answered honestly, and silently
returning it as zero would *reproduce the #291 omission*.  Fail loud;
never return a non-eigenvalue.

The R7 :math:`(n,2n)` convention fork
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The historical spelling put the :math:`(n,2n)` emission in the
**numerator** as production,

.. math::

   k_{\text{old}} \;=\; \frac{R_{\nu\Sigma_f} + E_{2n}}{R_{\Sigma_a}},

which is a **non-eigenvalue** of the posed map whenever
:math:`\Sigma_2 \neq 0` *and* :math:`k \neq 1`.  The reason is exactly
the posing asymmetry: the inner solve scales **only** fission by
:math:`1/k`; the :math:`(n,2n)` emission is an *unscaled* gain in the
sweep source.  So the eigenvalue of that map is
:math:`k^\star = R_{\nu\Sigma_f}/(R_{\Sigma_a} - E_{2n})` (reflective,
:math:`L=0`), and putting the *unscaled* emission in the numerator does
not recover it.  Writing :math:`f = R_{\nu\Sigma_f}`,
:math:`a = R_{\Sigma_a}`, :math:`e = E_{2n} = 2s_2` and substituting
:math:`f = k^\star (a - e)`:

.. math::

   k_{\text{old}}
   \;=\; \frac{k^\star (a - e) + e}{a}
   \;=\; k^\star \;+\; \frac{2 s_2\,(1 - k^\star)}{a}.

The two agree only when :math:`s_2 = 0` (no :math:`(n,2n)`) or
:math:`k^\star = 1` (critical).  For a supercritical
:math:`k^\star > 1` the correction is negative
(:math:`k_{\text{old}} < k^\star`); for subcritical, positive.  The MoC
and CP pages carry the same fork
(:eq:`moc-keff-update`, :eq:`cp-keff-update`); CP was the one member
already spelled on net removal.

What was tried and found
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The #291 bias was characterised pre-fix (commit ``d1daaac``, Gauss–
Legendre :math:`n=8`, map-ratio ground truth noise :math:`\le 2\times
10^{-11}`) across the five gate configurations:

.. list-table:: Pre-fix reported :math:`k` vs the posed-problem eigenvalue :math:`k^\star`
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 40 18 18 24

     - 1.92857143
     - 2.61278195
     - :math:`-26.2\%` (R7 defect)

The two failure classes are visible in one table: the vacuum rows are
the **leakage omission** (#291) — the reported :math:`k` overshoots by
the leakage-to-absorption ratio :math:`L/A`; the last row is the **R7
:math:`(n,2n)` convention** — zero leakage, yet a
:math:`-26.2\%` error because the emission was mis-posed as production.
The reflective-control row is exactly the bit-identity guarantee above.
The exact check on the R7 row is
:math:`0.78/(0.5185 - 0.2200) = 2.61278`, and
:math:`(0.78 + 0.2200)/0.5185 = 1.92857` reproduces the old value —
matching :math:`k_{\text{old}} = k^\star + 2s_2(1-k^\star)/a` term for
term.

Post-fix, reported :math:`k` and the map-ratio :math:`k^\star` agree to
:math:`\le 6\times 10^{-10}` on all five.  The P\ :sub:`0`\ –P\ :sub:`1`
sphere gap :math:`\Delta` roughly **doubled** (:math:`1.404\times
10^{-2} \to 2.725\times 10^{-2}`) but stays inside the diagnostic
:math:`(10^{-3}, 5\times 10^{-2})` band — the P\ :sub:`1` anisotropic
correction is now measured against the correct eigenvalue on both
solves.

The V&V decision was a **principled re-baseline** (per ``vv-principles``
bit-identity-vs-principled-equivalence): the old reported :math:`k` was a
*different functional* from the posed problem's eigenvalue, so the new
value is not a regression to be tolerance-matched but a correction to be
verified against a structurally-independent reference (the fixed-point
map ratio).

Verification
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The permanent gate is
``tests/sn/eigenvalue/test_keff_estimator_gate.py``: it asserts the
reported :math:`k` equals the converged fixed-point map ratio
:math:`k^\star = P(M\phi^\star)/P(\phi^\star)` across the four physics
regimes — {vacuum slab, vacuum sphere (pinning the :math:`4\pi R^2`
face-area convention), reflective bitwise-degenerate, reflective
:math:`\Sigma_2\neq 0`} — with **in-file mutation teeth**: a
leakage-drop mutation reds the vacuum legs while staying bitwise-green
on reflective; a leakage sign-flip crash-reds through the scale-bridge
guard; and the old :math:`(n,2n)`-in-numerator convention reds the
:math:`\Sigma_2\neq 0` leg.

This is a **consistency** gate: the map ratio is the structurally-
independent ground truth for "does the estimator return the eigenvalue
of its own posed map", and is blind by construction to *which*
eigenvalue that is.  The SN solver's eigenvalue **correctness** — that
the posed map's eigenvalue is the *physically right* :math:`k` — rests
on the multi-group heterogeneous L1/L2 references elsewhere on this
page, not on this gate.

Two Inner Solvers
-----------------

**Source iteration (sweep-based):**

- Operator: :math:`T^{-1}` (diamond-difference sweep)
- Solution variable: scalar flux :math:`\phi(x, y, g)`
- Fixed-point: :math:`\phi^{(k+1)} = T^{-1}(S \cdot \phi^{(k)} + Q_f)`
- Convergence rate: spectral radius of :math:`T^{-1}S` (~0.97 for 421
  groups)
- Cost per iteration: one transport sweep
- Works for all geometries

**Krylov (direct operator):**

- Operator: :math:`L + C` applied matrix-free
  (:meth:`InvertibleOperator.apply` — the same one-walk
  discretization as the sweep; L21 matvec ≡ sweep)
- Solution variable: angular flux :math:`\psi(x, y, n, g)` (much
  larger than scalar flux)
- System: :math:`(L+C)\psi = b` where :math:`b` = fission + scattering
- Convergence: GMRES with sweep preconditioner, typically ~100
  Krylov iterations at ``tol=1e-4`` (always converges)
- Available for all geometries (Cartesian, spherical, cylindrical)

Wave E Round 2 (Issue #164) replaced the legacy BiCGSTAB FD-operator
path with this Krylov path.  See the Krylov alternative in
:doc:`slab_one_group` for the full discussion.

The two paths share the **one** loss-representation discretization
(matvec ≡ sweep, #206 Phase C), so they converge to the same fixed
point; the Wave-D-era design in which they carried different spatial
closures — and disagreed on coarse-mesh :math:`\keff` — is recorded
in the streaming-collision history section above.


.. _sn-consuming-the-frame:

Consuming the frame in SN
=========================

Spatial homogenisation and energy condensation are **discrete-frame
projections** — the Petrov-Galerkin coefficient extraction
:math:`G^{-1}M` of a flux- (or spectrum-) weighted frame. All of that
theory — rate preservation, the source-group / sink-sum matrix rules, the
metric-fold-vs-bilinear adjoint argument, fractional-overlap re-binning,
the condense/homogenize asymmetry law, and the verification gates — is
the frame page's headline **Petrov-Galerkin** consumer; see
:ref:`sn-spatial-homogenization` and :ref:`sn-energy-condensation`
(:doc:`/theory/foundations/frame`). This section keeps only the **SN-layer orchestration**:
how the SN :class:`~orpheus.sn.solution.Solution` drives that machinery
from a converged flux.

Homogenisation: the solve → homogenize → re-solve loop
------------------------------------------------------

:meth:`Solution.homogenize <orpheus.sn.solution.Solution.homogenize>`
takes a coarse mesh (:class:`~orpheus.geometry.mesh.Mesh1D` or
:class:`~orpheus.geometry.mesh.Mesh2D`) and returns a
:class:`~orpheus.transport.mesh.material_mesh.MaterialMesh` — the coarse
geometry already carrying one freshly-homogenised effective
:class:`~orpheus.data.macro_xs.mixture.Mixture` per coarse cell. The SN
:class:`~orpheus.sn.solution.Solution` owns the converged flux, so the SN
layer is what builds the flux-weighted **test** basis the frame consumes;
the frame itself, and the rate-preservation theory that *forces* the flux
weighting (rather than a plain volume average), live in
:ref:`sn-spatial-homogenization` (:doc:`/theory/foundations/frame`). The returned
``MaterialMesh`` is re-promoted to a solvable phase space by
:meth:`SNMesh.from_material_mesh
<orpheus.sn.mesh.augmented_mesh.SNMesh.from_material_mesh>`, closing the
**solve → homogenize → re-solve** loop. The return type is
**mesh-coupled** (geometry and materials born together) — the space half
of the condense/homogenize asymmetry law
(:ref:`sn-condense-homogenize-asymmetry`, :doc:`/theory/foundations/frame`).

Condensation: per-material representative spectra
-------------------------------------------------

:meth:`Solution.condense <orpheus.sn.solution.Solution.condense>` is the
SN-layer orchestration of energy condensation. It condenses **each
material with its own representative spectrum** — the flux·volume-weighted
flux over the cells where the material appears:

.. math::
   :label: energy-condensation-representative-spectrum

   \varphi^{(m)}_g \;=\;
   \sum_{i:\,\mathrm{mat}(i)=m} V_i\,\phi_{i,g},

.. (vv-status rationale) Representational identity: the per-material
   representative spectrum used as the condense test weight — the
   flux·volume-weighted flux over the material's cells (mirrors how
   ``homogenize`` derives its flux weight). A definition consumed by
   :meth:`Mixture.condense`; the end-to-end rate preservation it feeds is
   the L1 gate, not a separate claim.
.. vv-status: energy-condensation-representative-spectrum documented

used as the test weight in :meth:`Mixture.condense
<orpheus.data.macro_xs.mixture.Mixture.condense>` — the data-layer
collapse verb, whose spectrum-weighted-collapse theory is
:ref:`sn-energy-condensation` (:doc:`/theory/foundations/frame`) — mirroring how
:meth:`Solution.homogenize` derives its flux weight from the same solved
flux. The result is a **portable** ``dict[int, Mixture]`` keyed by
material id — few-group cross sections carrying the coarse ``eg``, not
bound to any mesh (the **mesh-decoupled** half of the asymmetry law,
:ref:`sn-condense-homogenize-asymmetry`, :doc:`/theory/foundations/frame`). A material with
no flux in a fine group contributes zero weight there; the condense
frame's Moore–Penrose Gram handles any empty coarse group.


.. _sn-gotchas:

Gotchas
=======

Each gotcha is a **consequence → how it manifests → which test / level
catches it** — a trap that hides a solver bug behind a green test.  They
should *shrink* over time as the code hardens.

Degeneracy traps — a passing test that proves nothing
-----------------------------------------------------

.. admonition:: Gotcha — 1-group eigenvalue tests are degenerate
   :class: warning

   :math:`k = \nu\Sigma_f / \Sigma_a` is **flux-shape independent**: a
   1-group eigenvalue is a material-property ratio computable *without*
   solving the transport equation, so it cannot detect any error in the
   spatial, angular, or scattering operators.  **Any verification claim
   needs** :math:`\geq 2` **groups** (``vv-principles`` anti-pattern #3).  A
   1-group eigenvalue is still fine for a *rate* or *convergence-order*
   claim — declare the claim layer.

.. _sn-homogeneous-degeneracy-gotcha:

.. admonition:: Gotcha — homogeneous / uniform-rescale invariance hides coefficient bugs
   :class: warning

   Any eigenvalue problem whose target is the flux :math:`\phi` is invariant
   under a uniform rescale :math:`\phi \to C\phi` (the factor :math:`C`
   cancels in the Rayleigh quotient
   :math:`k = \nu\Sigma_f\,\phi / \Sigma_a\,\phi`).  Homogeneous and
   same-material multi-region problems have a **spatially-uniform** rescale,
   so they are blind to factor-of-two coefficient errors that preserve the
   flux shape — and, in curvilinear geometry, blind to redistribution bugs
   (flat flux → the :math:`\alpha` terms vanish identically).  Only a
   genuine **material interface** makes the rescale factor :math:`C(x)`
   position-dependent and breaks the cancellation.

   This is exactly how **ERR-025** hid.  A missing :math:`1/W` normalisation
   in the 1-D diamond-difference recurrence halved the per-ordinate flux, but
   for Gauss–Legendre :math:`W = \sum_n w_n = 2` the missing factor rescaled
   it back — so every homogeneous test passed at machine precision while the
   heterogeneous eigenvalue was :math:`\sim 1.5\,\%` wrong and did **not**
   converge away under mesh or :math:`S_N`-order refinement (the gap
   plateaued in angle).

   **Catcher:** at least one *absolute*-:math:`\phi` test — the fixed-source
   flat-flux diagnostic (:math:`Q/\Sigma_t`), or an absolute eigenvalue
   comparison against a structurally-independent heterogeneous reference.
   The live pins are the L0 symbolic-recurrence check
   :func:`tests.sn.sweep.slab.test_dd_recurrence.test_dd_per_cell_recurrence_matches_symbolic_derivation`
   and the L1 heterogeneous absolute-:math:`k` regression
   :func:`tests.sn.eigenvalue.test_keff_slab.test_heterogeneous_absolute_keff`
   (a 2-region A+B reflective slab pinned against the Case
   singular-eigenfunction reference; the pre-fix :math:`1.48\times10^{-2}`
   error fails it by two orders of magnitude).

.. admonition:: Gotcha — conservation holds even with wrong per-ordinate balance
   :class: warning

   Global particle balance **telescopes** by construction, so a *scalar*
   balance sum can hold to machine precision while the *per-ordinate*
   flat-flux residual is wrong (``vv-principles`` anti-pattern #8; the
   identity :math:`\sum_n w_n(\alpha_{n+1/2} - \alpha_{n-1/2}) = 0`
   annihilates per-ordinate redistribution errors that cancel in the sum).
   The load-bearing invariant is the **per-ordinate** flat-flux residual
   (= 0), not the telescoped scalar balance.

Curvilinear redistribution
--------------------------

.. admonition:: Gotcha — the α redistribution dome must stay non-negative
   :class: warning

   The curvilinear :math:`\alpha` dome must be non-negative; a negative entry
   drives NaN / overflow through the angular sweep.  The fixed-source
   flat-flux diagnostic (:math:`Q/\Sigma_t`) is the single most powerful
   curvilinear bug detector — a spike at :math:`r = 0` localises a missing
   :math:`\Delta A / w` geometry factor.

Solver-coordination traps
-------------------------

* **Renormalise-then-report ordering.**
  :func:`~orpheus.numerics.eigenvalue.power_iteration` renormalises
  :math:`\phi` to unit production **between**
  :meth:`~orpheus.sn.solver.SNSolver.solve_fixed_source` and
  :meth:`~orpheus.sn.solver.SNSolver.compute_keff`.  So
  ``compute_keff`` sees the *renormalised* :math:`\phi`, while the stored
  ``_psi_typed.boundary`` is the *un-renormalised* trace — the scale
  bridge above is what makes the leakage term consistent across that
  boundary.  Reordering the two (report before renormalise) would break
  the bridge's ``1.0`` shortcut.
* **The outer iterate must stay a bare** ``np.ndarray``.  The Mode-11
  live-arm sentinel in
  ``tests/sn/operators/test_fission_kernel_crosscheck.py`` proves that
  ``power_iteration`` feeds a **bare** :class:`numpy.ndarray` flux to
  :meth:`~orpheus.sn.solver.SNSolver.compute_fission_source`, so the
  bare-``np.ndarray`` dispatch arm of
  :meth:`FissionOperator.apply
  <orpheus.transport.operators.fission.FissionOperator>` is the *live
  production arm* (the sentinel wraps that registered leaf in-process and
  asserts the counter advances).  The estimator's
  :class:`~orpheus.transport.reaction_rate_functional.IntegratedReactionRate`
  evaluations read the same bare array.  Routing the outer iterate
  through a typed carrier would dark the arm (redding the sentinel) and
  break the estimator's evaluate path — the bare-array outer iterate is
  a load-bearing contract, not an implementation accident.

   **Sweep-machinery gotchas** — the Krylov ``restart`` sizing bug
   (ERR-053 family), the product-cylinder edge-extrapolation data-flow
   invariant, and the Mode-12 / ERR-067 :math:`G`-reciprocity metric catch
   — are documented alongside the sweep at :ref:`sn-282-gotchas`.

   the diagonal-cubature shared-face rule (ERR-056), under the
   boundary Gauss-Seidel schedule above: a boundary face outflowed
   by several octants must be reduced (reflected) only after the
   LAST contributing octant group has swept it.

   :math:`r = 0` is intrinsically singular in any curvilinear streaming
   operator because the angular-derivative coefficients contain
   :math:`1/r`.  Cited at

   Expands the within-coarse-group flux in a set of orthogonal functions;
   the **zeroth moment** (the piecewise-constant basis function on the
   coarse group) recovers the standard flux-weighted multigroup average
   exactly, and the higher moments add the within-group spectral detail.
   Cited at :ref:`sn-condensation-petrov-galerkin-frame` as the rank-0
