Operator Algebra Architecture
=============================

ORPHEUS' transport, eigenvalue, and Krylov solvers all act on a flux
distribution by composing a small set of linear operators — the
streaming + collision operator :math:`L`, the scattering operator
:math:`S`, the fission operator :math:`F`. The
:mod:`orpheus.numerics.operator` module installs these as a uniform
*matrix-free* algebra so that the eigenvalue, fixed-source, and
preconditioned Krylov code can consume any solver method (SN / MoC /
CP / diffusion) without knowing which transport discretisation lives
underneath. This page is the **Phase 0** stub for that algebra; the
full unifying narrative lands progressively under the Wave H refactor
(Issue 18).

Key Facts
=========

- The transport eigenvalue and fixed-source problems share a single
  operator algebra (Trefethen & Bau 1997, §3.2):

  .. (vv-status rationale) Phase 0 stub label for the transport
     fixed-source operator-algebra form. The verifiable claim — that
     a Phase-1 SN/MoC/CP solver assembles its operator triple
     (L, S, F) and lets ``op = L - S - F`` agree with the legacy
     fixed-source path bit-for-bit — is queued for Issues 9-13.
  .. vv-status: operator-fixed-source documented

  .. math::
     :label: operator-fixed-source

     (L - S - F)\,\psi \;=\; q
     \qquad \text{(fixed source)}

  .. (vv-status rationale) Phase 0 stub label for the transport
     eigenvalue operator-algebra form. Verified by Issue 14's unified
     iteration driver consuming (L - S, F) triples, and by the
     existing eigenvalue test suites once they are migrated to the
     new contract.
  .. vv-status: operator-eigenvalue documented

  .. math::
     :label: operator-eigenvalue

     (L - S)\,\psi \;=\; \tfrac{1}{k}\,F\,\psi
     \qquad \text{(eigenvalue)}

  Both are built from operator addition, scalar multiplication, and
  composition (``+``, ``-``, ``*``, ``@``) acting on
  :class:`~orpheus.numerics.operator.LinearOperator` instances.

- The :class:`~orpheus.numerics.operator.LinearOperator` Protocol
  carries one mandatory method (``apply``) and a
  ``capabilities: frozenset[str]`` property advertising which optional
  methods (``solve``, ``apply_transpose``) are functional.

- The capability set is the **single source of truth** for what an
  operator can do. Composition primitives compute their own capability
  set from constituents; mismatches raise
  :class:`~orpheus.numerics.operator.MissingCapability` at composition
  time, NEVER at call time.

- :func:`~orpheus.numerics.operator.as_scipy_linop` adapts any
  :class:`LinearOperator` to scipy's Krylov solvers (BiCGSTAB, GMRES)
  via :class:`scipy.sparse.linalg.LinearOperator` — preserving the
  capability set as the gate that decides whether ``rmatvec`` is
  exposed.


Definitions
===========

The three primitive actions on a flux vector :math:`\psi`:

.. (vv-status rationale) Phase 0 stub label for the ``apply`` primitive
   action. Verified at the protocol level by
   ``tests/numerics/test_operator.py`` (foundation-tagged software
   invariants); a per-solver Phase-1 test will check that each
   solver's ``L.apply(x)`` matches its legacy path bit-for-bit.
.. vv-status: operator-apply documented

.. math::
   :label: operator-apply

   \texttt{apply} \;:\; x \;\mapsto\; L\,x

.. (vv-status rationale) Phase 0 stub label for the ``solve``
   primitive action — the algorithmic dual of ``apply``, NOT the
   matrix inverse. Verified at the protocol level by
   ``tests/numerics/test_operator.py``; per-solver verification is
   queued for the BiCGSTAB-consumer migration (Issue 15).
.. vv-status: operator-solve documented

.. math::
   :label: operator-solve

   \texttt{solve} \;:\; b \;\mapsto\; L^{-1}\,b
   \quad \text{(the algorithmic dual of } \texttt{apply}\text{)}

.. (vv-status rationale) Phase 0 stub label for the
   ``apply_transpose`` primitive action. Verified at the protocol
   level by ``tests/numerics/test_operator.py``; per-solver adjoint
   sensitivity tests are queued for the sensitivity track (Issue 17).
.. vv-status: operator-apply-transpose documented

.. math::
   :label: operator-apply-transpose

   \texttt{apply\_transpose} \;:\; x \;\mapsto\; L^{T}\,x

The dual relationship in :eq:`operator-solve` is **algorithmic**, not
matrix-theoretic: ``solve(L, b)`` returns whatever vector the
operator's solve algorithm produces such that
``apply(solve(b)) ≈ b`` to working precision. For a sparse direct
factorisation this is the matrix inverse; for an iterative
preconditioned solver it is an approximate inverse; for a
matrix-vector product wrapping BiCGSTAB it is the Krylov approximate
solution. The protocol does NOT require ``apply ∘ solve = I`` exactly
— only that ``solve`` advertises a meaningful approximation. Operators
without an efficient ``solve`` simply do not advertise that
capability, and downstream code declines them at composition time.


Capability set semantics
========================

The capability set is :class:`frozenset[str]` rather than a class
hierarchy because many transport operators have **no** efficient
``solve``:

- The scattering source operator :math:`S` has rank in the thousands
  of unknowns and is never inverted directly (the source iteration
  scheme exists precisely to avoid that inversion).
- The fission source operator :math:`F` is rank-deficient — it
  projects onto the fission spectrum :math:`\chi`. There is no
  inverse.
- A Jacobi-preconditioned matvec wrapped for BiCGSTAB has ``apply``
  but no ``solve`` (the solve is the iterative scheme itself, not
  this operator).

Subclassing or abstract methods would force these classes to provide
``solve`` stubs that raise :class:`NotImplementedError`. That is the
**harmful-stub anti-pattern**: downstream Krylov consumers would only
discover the failure mid-iteration. The capability-set contract is
"I can do *these* things" rather than "I can do everything or
fail" — composers veto incompatible compositions at construction
time.

The set is open in the sense that user operators MAY advertise
method-specific capability tags (e.g. a custom preconditioner could
add ``"jacobi-preconditioned"``); composers ignore tags they do not
understand, propagating only the three primitive ones.


Composition algebra
===================

The composers in :mod:`orpheus.numerics.operator` implement the
following closure laws:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 22 26 26 26

   * - Composer
     - ``apply``
     - ``solve``
     - ``apply_transpose``
   * - :class:`~orpheus.numerics.operator.OperatorSum`
       (:math:`A + B`)
     - Both must have ``apply``.
     - **Does not propagate.** No general algorithm exists for
       :math:`(A + B)^{-1}` from :math:`A^{-1}, B^{-1}`
       (Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury applies only under low-rank
       structure).
     - Both must have ``apply_transpose``;
       :math:`(A + B)^T = A^T + B^T`.
   * - :class:`~orpheus.numerics.operator.OperatorProduct`
       (:math:`A\,B`)
     - Both must have ``apply`` (function composition).
     - Both must have ``solve``, **applied in REVERSE order**:
       :math:`(A\,B)^{-1} = B^{-1}\,A^{-1}`.
     - Both must have ``apply_transpose``, applied in REVERSE order:
       :math:`(A\,B)^T = B^T\,A^T`.
   * - :class:`~orpheus.numerics.operator.ScaledOperator`
       (:math:`\alpha\,L`)
     - Always preserved.
     - Preserved with division:
       :math:`(\alpha L)^{-1} = (1/\alpha)\,L^{-1}`. Zero scalar is
       rejected — use :class:`ZeroOperator` instead.
     - Preserved (scalars commute with transpose).
   * - :class:`~orpheus.numerics.operator.IdentityOperator`
       (:math:`I`)
     - Trivially yes.
     - ``solve`` is the same code path as ``apply``:
       :math:`I^{-1} = I`.
     - Trivially yes: :math:`I^T = I`.
   * - :class:`~orpheus.numerics.operator.ZeroOperator`
       (:math:`0`)
     - Trivially yes (returns ``np.zeros_like(x)``).
     - **Does not propagate.** The zero operator is not invertible.
     - Trivially yes (returns zero).

The closure rules above are enforced at composition time via
:class:`~orpheus.numerics.operator.MissingCapability`; a downstream
consumer that requests ``solve`` on :math:`L = A + 0` cannot silently
hit a meaningless answer because the sum has already vetoed
``solve`` propagation.


Cross-solver consumption (forward reference)
============================================

The Phase 0 algebra is the foundation for the cross-solver migration
sequence: SN, MoC, CP, and diffusion will each expose their natural
operator triple :math:`(L, S, F)` as
:class:`~orpheus.numerics.operator.LinearOperator` instances, and a
unified iteration driver in :mod:`orpheus.numerics.iteration` will
consume those triples without knowing which transport discretisation
they came from. That driver is **to be installed** under the Wave H
refactor (Issue 14). The Phase 0 module ships the algebra; subsequent
phases mount the producers and the consumer onto it.

Today the existing
:func:`build_transport_linear_operator <orpheus.sn.operator.build_transport_linear_operator>`
functions in :mod:`orpheus.sn.operator` continue to wrap their matvec
in :class:`scipy.sparse.linalg.LinearOperator` directly, untouched by
this module. The :func:`as_scipy_linop` adapter exists so that when
those call sites migrate to the ORPHEUS protocol (Issue 15), the
scipy interop continues to work without rewriting BiCGSTAB / GMRES
inner loops.
