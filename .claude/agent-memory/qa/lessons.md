## L-001 -- Test count is not coverage

20 passing tests (homogeneous exact, conservation, balance,
non-negativity) missed a fundamental 2-term bug in cylindrical DD.
Signature: keff diverging under mesh refinement (1.15 -> 0.90 -> 0.52).

**Rule**: When reviewing "all tests pass" for any solver, first ask:
"Is there a heterogeneous mesh-refinement convergence test?"
If not, the suite proves nothing about the transport operator.
