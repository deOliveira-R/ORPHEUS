# QA Agent Memory — index

## 1. Lessons — a HOT digest over a COLD archive

Two files, read at different times. Do **not** summarize lesson content here.

- **[lessons.md](lessons.md)** — the HOT digest (~377 lines). Behavioral rules
  only: one imperative rule + its failure→correction core + a
  `→ lessons_archive.md L-0NN` pointer. Nine sections: **A** mutation mechanics,
  **B** structural blindness, **C** structural independence, **D**
  re-baseline/bit-identity, **E** markers & audit surface, **F** claim-scope,
  **G** doc-correctness, **H** mechanics/environment, **I** the map of what is
  already in `vv-principles`/`numerical-bug-signatures` (point, don't restate).
  **Read this before every review.**
- **[lessons_archive.md](lessons_archive.md)** — the COLD archive (2572 lines,
  L-001..L-062, append-ordered). War stories, evidence, `file:line`, measured
  tables, verdicts. **Open only the specific `L-0NN` a digest rule points at** —
  never read it whole (it is ~45K tokens).

Maintenance: a new lesson appends `L-0NN` to the archive AND lands a 2–5 line
rule in the digest. Sharpen the digest in place; if it drifts past ~400 lines,
distill (encode a shared meta-lesson once, list its instances) — never truncate.

## 2. Active / in-flight state

None. All SN review campaigns behind L-001..L-062 are merged to
`main` (verified via `git merge-base --is-ancestor`). Only #236
(`feature/sn-spatial-angular-product`) remains open at the repo level, but it
carries no unresolved QA finding here. Git is authoritative for merge status —
re-verify before acting on any "in-flight" claim.

## 3. Durable reference (topic files)

- [field_role_typing_apply_sourcesink_contract.md](field_role_typing_apply_sourcesink_contract.md)
  — re-checkable SN role contract (`.apply`=AngularSourceSink,
  `.solve`=AngularFlux) + the A2D-1 source-hash-pin update procedure +
  affine-gate test-migration playbook. Cited by `qa/AGENT.md` enforcement
  rule #10 — **durable**.
- [phase1_moment_space_review.md](phase1_moment_space_review.md) — the
  ERR-039 moment-space P1.1–P1.7 verification-of-record; cited as the
  verification artifact by 3 plan/agent files — **durable**.
- [issue_247_legA_review.md](issue_247_legA_review.md) — full #247 Leg A
  (slope-source) review; distilled into L-037. **Retire candidate** (merged
  campaign; the reusable behavior is in the lesson).
- [issue_251_legB_review.md](issue_251_legB_review.md) — full #251 Leg B
  (boundary face-slope) review; distilled into L-038. **Retire candidate**
  (merged campaign; the reusable behavior is in the lesson).
